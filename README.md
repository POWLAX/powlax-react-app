2. **Player Situations** (5 universal scenarios with phase-specific variations)
3. **Game Phases** (Face Off, Transition, Settled Offense/Defense, Special Teams)
4. **Age-Based Progression**: Overlapping developmental ranges where skills progress from introduction (do_it: 6-10), through competitive application (coach_it: 8-12), to mastery (own_it: 10-14)

## üìã Existing Development Plans

### Phase-Based Implementation Strategy
Following 8 hours of intensive brainstorming, the project has three detailed phase plans:

- **Phase 1**: Core System & Practice Planner (see `[stage1-implementation.md]`)
  - Enhanced practice planning with strategic depth
  - Drill-Strategy-Concept-Skill relationships
  - Core user management
  
- **Phase 2**: Skills Academy & Gamification (see `[stage2-implementation.md]`)
  - LearnDash migration to modern React
  - 6-tier gamification system
  - Progress tracking and achievements
  
- **Phase 3**: Team Management & Community (see `[stage3-implementation.md]`)
  - BuddyBoss replacement
  - Advanced registration system
  - Community features

These plans provide the strategic foundation but will be validated and enhanced through the BMad method's systematic approach to ensure nothing is missed and all components integrate properly.

### Next Steps
1. Use BMad Analyst to validate existing plans
2. Create formal BMad documentation structure
3. Generate PRD incorporating all phase elements
4. Begin systematic implementation
