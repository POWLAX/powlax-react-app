## üî¥ **CRITICAL QUESTIONS REQUIRING ANSWERS**

### **Architecture & Design Questions**

1. **Sub Agent Token Management**
   - How is the 200k token window managed per agent?
   - What happens when context exceeds limits?
   - How is context pruned between agent handoffs?

2. **Folder Context System**
   - Where exactly should folder-specific context files be placed?
   - How do agents discover and load relevant context?
   - What's the naming convention for context files?

3. **Agent Coordination**
   - How do agents communicate state between each other?
   - What's the protocol for parallel agent execution?
   - How are conflicts resolved when multiple agents modify same files?

### **Implementation Questions**

4. **Rollback Procedures**
   - What's the rollback strategy for failed features?
   - How do we revert database migrations safely?
   - What's the disaster recovery plan?

5. **Branch Management**
   - Should all new features use "new-" prefix pattern?
   - How do we handle legacy page updates vs new implementations?
   - What's the merge strategy for feature branches?

6. **Quality Gates**
   - What are the mandatory quality gates before deployment?
   - How do we validate mobile field usage compliance?
   - What's the minimum test coverage requirement?

### **Integration Questions**

7. **WordPress Migration**
   - What's the timeline for complete WordPress deprecation?
   - How do we maintain dual auth during transition?
   - What happens to existing WordPress integrations?

8. **Performance Targets**
   - What are acceptable response times for field usage?
   - How do we measure 3G network performance?
   - What's the maximum acceptable bundle size?

9. **Data Migration**
   - Are all CSV imports validated and tested?
   - How do we handle data conflicts during migration?
   - What's the backup strategy for production data?

### **Operational Questions**

10. **Monitoring & Maintenance**
    - How do we monitor sub agent performance?
    - What metrics track system health?
    - Who maintains agent definitions post-launch?

11. **Training & Documentation**
    - How do new developers learn the sub agent system?
    - Where's the troubleshooting guide for common issues?
    - What's the escalation path for agent failures?

12. **Scaling Considerations**
    - How does the system handle increased load?
    - What's the strategy for adding new sub agents?
    - How do we deprecate outdated agents?

## üí° **RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **High Priority**
1. **Create ROLLBACK_PROCEDURES.md** with step-by-step recovery plans
2. **Implement folder context system** with clear examples
3. **Build integration test suite** for agent coordination

### **Medium Priority**
1. **Document branch strategy** in GITHUB_WORKFLOW.md
2. **Create monitoring dashboard** for agent performance
3. **Establish quality gate automation** in CI/CD pipeline

## üìù **CONCLUSION**

The POWLAX sub agent system represents a significant architectural improvement over the BMad/A4CC approach, with better specialization, clearer responsibilities, and improved context management. The core transformation is **successful**, but several **critical operational gaps** must be addressed before production deployment.

**Ready for Development?** YES, with caveats
**Ready for Production?** NO, pending gap resolution

The system shows excellent promise for handling POWLAX's complex requirements around mobile field usage, age-appropriate interfaces, and coaching workflow optimization. With the identified gaps addressed, this architecture should provide a robust foundation for the platform's continued growth.
