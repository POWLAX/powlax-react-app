# üîç CLAUDE CODE VERIFICATION PROMPT

**Purpose:** Verify POWLAX authentication architecture understanding  
**For:** New Claude Code instances with no prior context  
**Critical:** Must understand self-contained system approach  

---

## üìã **VERIFICATION CHECKLIST FOR CLAUDE CODE**

Please analyze the POWLAX codebase and confirm your understanding by answering these questions:

### **1. Authentication System Understanding**
- ‚ùì What authentication system is currently implemented?
- ‚ùì What authentication system is planned for production?
- ‚ùì Are there any WordPress authentication integrations planned?
- ‚ùì What is the role of MemberPress in this system?

### **2. Payment System Architecture**
- ‚ùì What payment system will be used for subscriptions?
- ‚ùì Are there any MemberPress API integrations planned?
- ‚ùì How will subscription management work?
- ‚ùì What external payment dependencies exist?

### **3. Database Integration**
- ‚ùì What is the primary database system?
- ‚ùì Are there WordPress database dependencies?
- ‚ùì How is user data managed?
- ‚ùì What tables handle subscription/membership data?

### **4. API Architecture**
- ‚ùì What APIs exist for WordPress integration?
- ‚ùì What is the purpose of `/api/wordpress/memberpress/route.ts`?
- ‚ùì What external API calls are planned for production?
- ‚ùì How will email services be handled?

- **MemberPress APIs:** ‚ùå NO - Webhook only, no API calls
- **Subscription Management:** Internal system with Stripe
- **External Dependencies:** Stripe/PayPal only, no WordPress

### **Database:**
- **Primary DB:** Supabase PostgreSQL
- **WordPress Dependencies:** ‚ùå NO - Self-contained system
- **User Management:** Supabase Auth + internal user tables
- **Subscription Tables:** `user_subscriptions`, `stripe_customers` (planned)

### **APIs:**
- **WordPress APIs:** ‚ùå NONE - All marked for removal/replacement
- **MemberPress Route:** Development placeholder only - NOT for production
- **External APIs:** Stripe, SendGrid only
- **Email Service:** SendGrid (self-contained), no WordPress

## üö® **CRITICAL WARNINGS TO UNDERSTAND**

### **RED FLAGS - NEVER IMPLEMENT:**
1. WordPress JWT authentication
2. WordPress user synchronization
3. MemberPress API calls (beyond webhook receiver)
4. WordPress email integration
5. WordPress session management

### **GREEN FLAGS - ALWAYS IMPLEMENT:**
1. Supabase Auth patterns
2. Stripe payment integration
3. Self-contained subscription logic
4. Internal email systems (SendGrid)
5. Database-first architecture

## üéØ **VERIFICATION QUESTIONS FOR YOU**

**Please answer these to confirm understanding:**

1. **If asked to implement user authentication, what system would you use?**
   - ‚úÖ Correct: Supabase Auth with magic links
   - ‚ùå Wrong: WordPress integration, MemberPress auth

2. **If asked to implement subscription payments, what would you build?**

   - ‚ùå Wrong: MemberPress API integration, WordPress payments

3. **If you see WordPress integration code in the codebase, what should you do?**
   - ‚úÖ Correct: Flag for removal, replace with self-contained alternative
   - ‚ùå Wrong: Build upon it, extend WordPress integration

4. **What is the ONLY acceptable MemberPress integration?**
   - ‚úÖ Correct: Webhook receiver for membership status sync
   - ‚ùå Wrong: API calls, user sync, authentication

5. **If asked to add email functionality, what service would you use?**
