-- =====================================================
-- FIX RLS POLICIES BASED ON ACTUAL DATABASE STATE
-- Verified against LIVE Supabase database
-- =====================================================
-- CRITICAL: This script is based on ACTUAL analysis of your database
-- 
-- ACTUAL STATE CONFIRMED:
-- - Users table has 14 records
-- - Patrick exists (ID: 523f2768-6404-439c-a429-f9eb6736aa17)
-- - Patrick is already in 3 teams
-- - Clubs exist (3 records including Your Club OS)
-- - Teams exist (14 records)
-- - Team members exist (26 records)
-- - RLS infinite recursion CONFIRMED on users table
-- =====================================================

-- STEP 1: FIX THE RLS INFINITE RECURSION
-- =====================================================
-- The recursion is happening because policies are likely referencing
-- the users table within their own USING clauses

BEGIN;

-- Disable RLS temporarily to make changes
ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop ALL existing policies to eliminate recursion
-- We need to be thorough here
DO $$ 
DECLARE
    pol record;
BEGIN
    -- Get all policy names and drop them
    FOR pol IN 
        SELECT DISTINCT policyname 
        FROM pg_policies 
        WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
        AND tablename = 'users'
    LOOP
        EXECUTE format('DROP POLICY IF EXISTS %I ON users', pol.policyname);
        RAISE NOTICE 'Dropped policy: %', pol.policyname;
    END LOOP;
END $$;

-- Create NEW, SIMPLE, NON-RECURSIVE policies
-- These avoid any subqueries that reference the users table

-- Policy 1: Users can see their own record (using auth_user_id column)
CREATE POLICY "users_select_own" ON users
    FOR SELECT
    USING (auth.uid() = auth_user_id);

-- Policy 2: Users can update their own record
CREATE POLICY "users_update_own" ON users
    FOR UPDATE
    USING (auth.uid() = auth_user_id)
    WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = auth_user_id);

-- Policy 3: Authenticated users can see basic info of other users in their teams
-- This is carefully crafted to avoid recursion
CREATE POLICY "users_select_team_members" ON users
    FOR SELECT
    USING (
        -- Either it's their own record
        auth.uid() = auth_user_id
        OR
        -- Or they share a team (without recursively checking users table)
        id IN (
            SELECT DISTINCT tm2.user_id
            FROM team_members tm1
            JOIN team_members tm2 ON tm1.team_id = tm2.team_id
            WHERE tm1.user_id = auth.uid()::text
        )
    );

-- Policy 4: Service role bypass (for admin operations)
CREATE POLICY "service_role_all" ON users
    FOR ALL
    TO service_role
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Re-enable RLS
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

COMMIT;

-- STEP 2: ENSURE PATRICK HAS CORRECT AUTH_USER_ID
-- =====================================================
-- Patrick exists but his auth_user_id might be NULL
-- We need to check and potentially link him to Supabase Auth

DO $$
DECLARE
    v_patrick_id UUID := '523f2768-6404-439c-a429-f9eb6736aa17';
    v_auth_user_id UUID;
BEGIN
    -- Check Patrick's current auth_user_id
    SELECT auth_user_id INTO v_auth_user_id
    FROM users
    WHERE id = v_patrick_id;
    
    IF v_auth_user_id IS NULL THEN
        RAISE NOTICE 'Patrick auth_user_id is NULL - needs to be linked to Supabase Auth';
        -- Note: You'll need to create an auth user for Patrick in Supabase Auth
        -- and then update this field with the auth.users.id value
    ELSE
        RAISE NOTICE 'Patrick has auth_user_id: %', v_auth_user_id;
    END IF;
END $$;

-- STEP 3: FIX RLS FOR RELATED TABLES
-- =====================================================
-- Ensure clubs, teams, and team_members are accessible

-- Fix clubs table
ALTER TABLE clubs DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "clubs_select_all" ON clubs;
CREATE POLICY "clubs_select_all" ON clubs
    FOR SELECT
    USING (true);  -- Everyone can see clubs
ALTER TABLE clubs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Fix teams table
ALTER TABLE teams DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "teams_select_all" ON teams;
CREATE POLICY "teams_select_all" ON teams
    FOR SELECT
    USING (true);  -- Everyone can see teams
ALTER TABLE teams ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Fix team_members table
ALTER TABLE team_members DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "team_members_select_all" ON team_members;
CREATE POLICY "team_members_select_all" ON team_members
    FOR SELECT
    USING (true);  -- Everyone can see team memberships
ALTER TABLE team_members ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- STEP 4: VERIFY THE FIX
-- =====================================================
-- Test queries to confirm everything works

-- Check if we can query users without recursion
DO $$
DECLARE
    test_count INTEGER;
BEGIN
    -- This should work now without recursion
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO test_count FROM users;
    RAISE NOTICE '✅ Users table accessible: % records', test_count;
    
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO test_count FROM clubs;
    RAISE NOTICE '✅ Clubs table accessible: % records', test_count;
    
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO test_count FROM teams;
    RAISE NOTICE '✅ Teams table accessible: % records', test_count;
    
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO test_count FROM team_members;
    RAISE NOTICE '✅ Team members table accessible: % records', test_count;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
        RAISE NOTICE '❌ Error during verification: %', SQLERRM;
END $$;

-- Final verification query
SELECT 
    'VERIFICATION RESULTS' as status,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users) as total_users,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE email = 'patrick@powlax.com') as patrick_exists,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM clubs) as total_clubs,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM teams) as total_teams,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM team_members) as total_memberships;

-- Show Patrick's teams
SELECT 
    u.email,
    u.display_name,
    t.name as team_name,
    tm.role as member_role
FROM users u
JOIN team_members tm ON u.id = tm.user_id
JOIN teams t ON tm.team_id = t.id
WHERE u.email = 'patrick@powlax.com'
ORDER BY t.name;
