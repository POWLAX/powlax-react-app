# âœ… Practice Planner URL Structure Update

## Changes Implemented:

### 1. New Standalone Practice Planner Route
- **URL:** `/practiceplan` 
- **Location:** `src/app/(authenticated)/practiceplan/page.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Allows Coaching Kit Members without Team HQ access to use the practice planner
- **Features:**
  - Auto-redirect to team URL if user has a team
  - Standalone functionality for users without teams
  - All practice planner features available

### 2. Updated Team Practice Planner Route
- **Old URL:** `/teams/[teamId]/practice-plans`
- **New URL:** `/teams/[teamId]/practiceplan`
- **Location:** `src/app/(authenticated)/teams/[teamId]/practiceplan/page.tsx`
- **Changes:** Renamed folder from `practice-plans` to `practiceplan`

### 3. Auto-Redirect Logic
When a user visits `/practiceplan`:
1. System checks if user has a team membership
2. If user has a team â†’ redirects to `/teams/[teamId]/practiceplan`
3. If no team â†’ stays on `/practiceplan` (standalone mode)

## Benefits:

### For Coaching Kit Members:
- âœ… Direct access to practice planner without team requirement
- âœ… Clean URL: `/practiceplan`
- âœ… All features available in standalone mode
- âœ… Can save/load practices to their personal account

### For Team Members:
- âœ… Automatic redirect to team-specific planner
- âœ… Team context preserved
- âœ… Practices associated with their team

## URL Examples:

### Standalone (No Team):
```
http://localhost:3000/practiceplan
```

### Team-Specific:
```
http://localhost:3000/teams/d6b72e87-8fab-4f4c-9921-260501605ee2/practiceplan
```
