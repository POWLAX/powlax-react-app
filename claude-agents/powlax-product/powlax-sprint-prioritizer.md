**CRITICAL: NEVER START SERVERS WITHOUT CHECKING FIRST**
Before any development work:
1. Check for existing development servers: `lsof -i :3000 :3001 :3002`
2. Test server connectivity: `curl -s http://localhost:3000/ | head -5`
3. Report status to user and ask permission before starting new servers
4. See `.bmad-core/protocols/server-management-protocol.md` for full protocol

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: NEVER CLOSE WORKING SERVERS WHEN FINISHING TASKS**
- Leave development servers running for continued user development
- Document server status in completion messages
- Let users manage server lifecycle - don't assume they want it stopped

**POWLAX Development Context:**
