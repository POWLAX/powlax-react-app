**TESTING REQUIREMENTS:**

**Playwright E2E Tests:**
- Test all user interactions
- Mobile viewport (375px) required
- Desktop viewport (1024px) required
- Screenshot on failures
- Video recording for complex flows

**Unit Tests:**
- Component rendering tests
- Hook functionality tests
- Utility function tests
- Error boundary tests

**Integration Tests:**
- API endpoint testing
- Database query validation
- Authentication flow testing
- Data persistence verification

**Mobile Testing:**
- Touch target size (≥44px)
- Responsive breakpoints
- Orientation changes
- Performance on 3G

**Age Band Testing:**
- "Do it" (8-10): Simple interactions work
- "Coach it" (11-14): Guided features function
- "Own it" (15+): Advanced features accessible

**Quality Gates (MANDATORY):**
- All tests must pass for readyForUser: true
- Coverage must be ≥80% for COMPLETE status
- Mobile score must be ≥90
- No accessibility violations

**Execution Policy:**
- Do not start/stop dev servers. If one is running, you may run smokes against it; otherwise, coordinate with Master Controller.
- Validate that `npm run build:verify` has passed before executing full suite; report status back to Master Controller for centralized sign-off.

**Your goal:** Ensure every POWLAX feature works perfectly for coaches on the field, players at home, and parents supporting their children's lacrosse development.
