## ðŸ“‹ **CONTRACT FIRST QUALITY CONTROL SYSTEM**

### **Assessment of Contract First Prompting for POWLAX**

The Contract First Prompting technique is **HIGHLY SUITABLE** for POWLAX quality control with adaptations:

**Strengths for POWLAX:**
1. **Intent Clarification**: Forces complete requirements before implementation
2. **95% Confidence Threshold**: Ensures thorough understanding before work begins
3. **Echo Check Validation**: Confirms shared understanding between agents
4. **Structured Escalation**: Clear paths for handling ambiguity

### **POWLAX Contract First Implementation**

```markdown
# POWLAX Feature Contract Protocol

## Phase 1: Gap Analysis (Before Any Code)
Master Controller initiates with sub agent:

1. **Silent Scan for Gaps:**
   - List all missing requirements
   - Identify undefined behaviors
   - Flag integration uncertainties
   - Note performance constraints

2. **Iterative Clarification:**
   - Ask one targeted question at a time
   - Dig into: Purpose, Users, Edge Cases, Mobile Constraints
   - Continue until 95% confidence achieved
   - Document all assumptions made

## Phase 2: Contract Echo Check
Sub agent provides crisp contract summary:

**Deliverable Contract:**
- Feature: [Exact feature being built]
- Users: [Specific user types and age bands]
- Success Criteria: [Measurable outcomes]
- Constraints: [Mobile, performance, integration]
- Quality Gates: [Specific tests that must pass]

**Master Controller Response Options:**
- "LOCK" - Proceed with implementation
- "EDIT" - Modify specific contract items
- "BLUEPRINT" - Request detailed implementation plan
- "RISKS" - Identify and mitigate risk areas

## Phase 3: Quality Gate Checkpoints
Automated gates at each phase:

1. **Planning Gate** (20+ minutes enforced)
   - Requirements documented
   - User stories complete
   - Technical approach defined

2. **Implementation Gate** (Every 15 minutes)
   - Lint passes
   - Build succeeds
   - No import errors

3. **Integration Gate** (Before handoff)
   - All tests pass
   - Mobile responsive verified
   - Performance benchmarks met

4. **Completion Gate** (Before marking done)
   - Documentation updated
   - Rollback procedures defined
   - Next agent briefed
```

## ðŸŽ® **MASTER AGENT PROMPTING STRATEGIES**

### **Effective Sub Agent Prompting Templates**

**Initial Task Assignment:**
```markdown
You are the powlax-frontend-developer sub agent. Your specialized expertise includes React, Next.js 14, TypeScript, Shadcn/UI components, and mobile-first responsive design for lacrosse coaching interfaces.

**YOUR MISSION:** Implement the workout builder enhancement for the Skills Academy feature.

**CONTEXT INHERITANCE:** You have access to the complete POWLAX project context including:
- System architecture: 33+ database tables, Supabase backend, Next.js frontend
- User personas: Coaches (primary), Players (by age band), Parents (support)
- Mobile constraints: 375px+ screens, 44px touch targets, outdoor visibility
- Quality requirements: <3s load time, 80% test coverage, WCAG AA compliance

**SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:**
1. Create a drill selection interface that works with gloved hands on mobile devices
2. Implement age-appropriate UI variations (do it: simple, coach it: guided, own it: advanced)
3. Integrate with existing workout_templates and drill_library tables
4. Maintain consistent Shadcn/UI component usage
5. Ensure high contrast for outdoor field visibility

**COORDINATION PROTOCOL:**
- Report progress every 2 hours using the standard JSON response format
- Escalate immediately if confidence drops below 85%
- Coordinate with powlax-backend-architect for API contracts
- Check for conflicts before modifying shared components

**QUALITY GATES:**
Before marking any phase complete, ensure:
- [ ] Lint passes without warnings
- [ ] Build succeeds without errors
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified at 375px, 768px, 1024px
- [ ] Age-appropriate interfaces validated
- [ ] Performance targets met (<3s load, <100ms interaction)

**CONTRACT CONFIRMATION:**
Please analyze this task and provide:
1. Your understanding of the requirements (echo check)
2. Any gaps or ambiguities you've identified
3. Your confidence level (must be >95% to proceed)
4. Estimated completion time with milestones

Do not begin implementation until we achieve contract agreement.
```

**Handling Sub Agent Feedback Requests:**
```markdown
I see you've identified [specific issue/ambiguity]. Let me clarify:

**CONTEXT CLARIFICATION:**
[Provide specific missing context]

**DECISION RATIONALE:**
[Explain why this approach was chosen]

**INTEGRATION GUIDANCE:**
[How this fits with other components]

**FALLBACK OPTION:**
If the primary approach doesn't work, implement [alternative approach] instead.

**ESCALATION TRIGGER:**
If you encounter [specific condition], stop work and request human intervention.

Please confirm this addresses your concern and update your confidence level.
```

**Quality Gate Enforcement:**
```markdown
QUALITY GATE CHECKPOINT - Please verify before proceeding:

**AUTOMATED CHECKS:**
```bash
npm run lint && npm run build && npm run test
```

**MANUAL VERIFICATION:**
1. Open the feature on a 375px width device/emulator
2. Test all touch targets are â‰¥44px
3. Verify high contrast mode for outdoor visibility
4. Test with browser dev tools network throttled to 3G
5. Confirm age-appropriate interface variations work

**PERFORMANCE VALIDATION:**
- Initial load time: [Current: ___ms, Target: <3000ms]
- Interaction response: [Current: ___ms, Target: <100ms]
- Bundle size impact: [Current: ___KB, Target: <50KB]

**ROLLBACK READINESS:**
- [ ] Feature flag configured and tested
- [ ] Database migrations reversible
- [ ] Recovery procedure documented
- [ ] Checkpoint state saved

Only proceed to next phase if ALL checks pass.
```

## ðŸ”§ **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION ANSWERS**

### **1. Token Management (200k Window)**

**Solution: Sliding Context Window with Priority Retention**
```markdown
Context Priority Levels:
1. CRITICAL (Always retained):
   - Current task specification
   - Active file contents
   - Immediate dependencies
   
2. IMPORTANT (Retained until 150k):
   - Related component code
   - Recent conversation history
   - Test specifications
   
3. REFERENCE (Pruned first):
   - Historical decisions
   - Completed task logs
   - Documentation excerpts

Pruning Strategy:
- At 180k tokens: Remove REFERENCE items older than 2 hours
- At 190k tokens: Summarize IMPORTANT items
- At 195k tokens: Create checkpoint and start new session
```

### **2. Folder Context System Implementation**

**Solution: Hierarchical Context Loading**
```
/src/components/skills-academy/
â”œâ”€â”€ .context/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md (component overview)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ patterns.md (established patterns)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dependencies.json (component dependencies)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test-requirements.md (testing approach)
```

**Auto-Discovery Protocol:**
```javascript
// Context loader for sub agents
function loadContextForPath(path) {
  const contexts = [];
  let currentPath = path;
  
  while (currentPath !== '/') {
    const contextPath = `${currentPath}/.context`;
    if (exists(contextPath)) {
      contexts.push(loadContext(contextPath));
    }
    currentPath = dirname(currentPath);
  }
  
  return mergeContexts(contexts);
}
```

### **3. Branch Strategy ("new-" Prefix System)**

**Solution: Progressive Enhancement Pattern**
```markdown
Feature Development Flow:

1. **Existing Page Enhancement:**
   - Keep original: /skills-academy/workouts/page.tsx
   - Create enhanced: /skills-academy/workouts/new-page.tsx
   - Route testing: Add ?preview=new parameter
   - Gradual migration: Move users progressively

2. **Branch Naming Convention:**
   feature/new-workout-builder     (new features)
   enhance/new-practice-planner    (improvements)
   fix/new-navigation-mobile       (bug fixes)

3. **Merge Strategy:**
   - new-* files reviewed separately
   - Original files untouched until validation
   - Feature flags control activation
   - Rollback = remove new-* files

4. **Promotion Process:**
   new-page.tsx â†’ page.tsx.backup â†’ page.tsx
   (enhanced)     (archive original)  (promoted)
```

### **4. Rollback Procedures**

**Solution: Multi-Layer Rollback System**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ROLLBACK_PROCEDURE.sh

# Level 1: Feature Flag Disable (Immediate)
echo "Disabling feature flag..."
supabase functions invoke set-feature-flag \
  --body '{"flag":"WORKOUT_BUILDER_V2","enabled":false}'

# Level 2: Code Rollback (5 minutes)
echo "Rolling back code changes..."
git checkout $LAST_STABLE_CHECKPOINT
npm install
npm run build

# Level 3: Database Rollback (10 minutes)
echo "Rolling back database..."
psql $DATABASE_URL < rollback/009_workout_builder_rollback.sql

# Level 4: Full Recovery (30 minutes)
echo "Full system recovery..."
./scripts/restore-from-backup.sh $BACKUP_ID

# Verification
npm run test:e2e
curl https://api.powlax.com/health
```

### **5. Integration Testing Strategy**

**Solution: Staged Integration Testing**
```markdown
Integration Test Levels:

1. **Component Integration (Every commit):**
   - Test component renders with real data
   - Verify Shadcn/UI component compatibility
   - Check responsive breakpoints

2. **Feature Integration (Every PR):**
   - End-to-end user journey testing
   - Cross-browser compatibility
   - Mobile device testing matrix

3. **System Integration (Pre-deployment):**
   - Full regression suite
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Security scanning
   - Accessibility audit

Parallel Agent Testing:
- Agents create test branches
- Automated merge and test
- Conflict detection before main merge
- Rollback if integration fails
```

### **6. Production Deployment Process**

**Solution: Progressive Deployment Pipeline**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: POWLAX Progressive Deployment

stages:
  - name: Development
    tests: [lint, build, unit]
    deploy: vercel-preview
    
  - name: Staging  
    tests: [e2e, performance, security]
    deploy: staging.powlax.com
    validation: 24-hour soak test
    
  - name: Production Canary
    deploy: 10% traffic
    monitoring: enhanced
    rollback: automatic on errors
    
  - name: Production Full
    deploy: 100% traffic
    monitoring: standard
    alerts: pagerduty
```

### **7. Monitoring & Alerting**

**Solution: Multi-Layer Monitoring**
```javascript
// monitoring-config.js
export const monitoringLayers = {
  agent_performance: {
    metrics: ['task_completion_time', 'quality_gate_passes'],
    alerts: ['completion_time > 4h', 'quality_fails > 2']
  },
  
  system_health: {
    metrics: ['response_time', 'error_rate', 'mobile_performance'],
    alerts: ['p95_response > 3s', 'error_rate > 1%']
  },
  
  user_experience: {
    metrics: ['page_load_time', 'interaction_delay', 'rage_clicks'],
    alerts: ['mobile_load > 5s', 'rage_clicks > 10/min']
  }
};
```

## ðŸš€ **QUICK START: NEW DEVELOPMENT SESSION**

### **Starting Your First Session (Copy & Paste)**

#### **Option 1: YOLO Mode (Fastest)**
```markdown
YOLO MODE ACTIVATED ðŸš€

Load POWLAX context and start building [feature/fix].
Make confident decisions, fix issues as you encounter them.
Mobile-first, age-appropriate required.
GO!
```

#### **Option 2: Guided Development**
```markdown
I need to build [feature] for POWLAX.
Use powlax-master-controller to coordinate.
Start with Contract First approach for clarity.
```

### **YOLO Mode Activation**
**Simple Activation:** Just add "YOLO mode:" or "YOLO this:" before any request
**When to Use:** Bug fixes, familiar patterns, MVPs, time-sensitive work
**When to Avoid:** Security features, payments, major architecture changes

### **Essential Development Commands**
```markdown
"YOLO mode: [task]"                    # Fast implementation
"Just build it: [feature]"             # Skip clarifications  
"Quick fix: [bug]"                     # Rapid debugging
"YOLO with tests: [feature]"           # Fast but tested
"YOLO production-safe: [task]"         # Quick but quality maintained
```
