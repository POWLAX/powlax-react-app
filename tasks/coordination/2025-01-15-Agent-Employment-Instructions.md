## ⏱️ **Timing & Coordination**

### **Hour 0-0.5: Infrastructure Only**
```bash
👤 YOU: Start with Workspace Organization Architect
🤖 Agent: Fix dependencies, get server running
✅ Success: Server returns 200 status codes
```

### **Hour 0.5-2: Parallel Stream Startup**
```bash
👤 YOU: Start both parallel agents simultaneously
🤖 Database Agent: Begin Team HQ database design
🤖 Gamification Agent: Start animation framework setup
📋 Coordination: Both agents can work independently
```

### **Hour 2-4: Main Development**
```bash
🤖 Database Agent: Build Team HQ components
🤖 Gamification Agent: Create team gamification features
📋 Coordination: Agents coordinate on team data structures
```

### **Hour 4-6: Integration & Testing**
```bash
🤖 Database Agent: Complete Team HQ dashboard
🤖 Gamification Agent: Integrate animations with Team HQ
📋 Coordination: Test full Team HQ + gamification experience
```

## 🤝 **Agent Coordination Protocol**

### **Critical Handoff Points**:

1. **Infrastructure → Parallel Streams**
   - Infrastructure agent confirms server stability
   - Both parallel agents can start immediately

2. **Database ↔ Gamification Coordination**
   - Database agent creates team tables
   - Gamification agent uses team data for points
   - Both agents share team-related interfaces

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Database agent confirms Team HQ functionality
   - Gamification agent confirms animations work in Team HQ
   - Test BuddyBoss integration together

---

## 📋 **Conflict Resolution**

### **No Conflicts Expected Between**:
- ✅ Database Team HQ work ↔ Gamification animations
- ✅ BuddyBoss integration ↔ Animation system
- ✅ Team dashboard ↔ Gamification widgets

### **Coordination Required For**:
- 🤝 Team data structure (Database defines, Gamification uses)
- 🤝 Team HQ component integration (both agents contribute)
- 🤝 BuddyBoss posting (Database creates events, Gamification triggers)
