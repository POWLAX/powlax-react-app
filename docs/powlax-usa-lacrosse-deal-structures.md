# Creative Deal Structures for POWLAX-USA Lacrosse Partnership

## Executive Summary

These deal structures are designed to maximize POWLAX's value capture while applying Hormozi's negotiation tactics. Each structure leverages your BATNA (14 years of content, proven platform), anchors high, uses multiple equivalent simultaneous offers (MESO), and frames value in terms of ROI and savings.

## Deal Structure Options
