- Lane indicators with absolute positioning
- Add button for additional parallel activities
```

#### 2. **DrillCard Component Update** ‚úÖ
**File:** `src/components/practice-planner/DrillCard.tsx`
- Added `parallelLane?: number` prop to interface
- Supports lane identification for parallel drills

### Phase 3 Initiation (Started üü°)

#### 1. **Field Mode View Component** ‚úÖ
**File:** `src/components/practice-planner/FieldModeView.tsx` (NEW)

**Features Implemented:**
- **Full-screen mobile interface** for field use
- **Large circular timer** with visual progress ring
- **Elapsed/remaining time** display
- **Touch-optimized controls** (64px+ targets)
- **Swipe gesture navigation** between drills
- **Parallel drill support** with lane display
- **Play/Pause/Reset** timer controls

## üöß Remaining Work

### Phase 3: Mobile Optimization (In Progress)
**Completed:**
- [x] Field Mode Interface component
- [x] Quick timer view with circular progress
- [x] Swipe navigation between drills
- [x] Minimal data usage design

**Still Needed:**
- [ ] Integration of FieldModeView into Practice Planner
- [ ] "Enter Field Mode" button in UI
- [ ] State persistence during field mode
- [ ] Offline support with service worker
- [ ] PWA manifest for installation
- [ ] Cache practice plans locally
- [ ] Sync when connection available

### Phase 4: Strategies Integration (Not Started)
- [ ] Connect drills to strategies
- [ ] Strategy-based practice building
- [ ] Skill progression tracking

---

## üêõ Known Issues & Warnings

### 1. Database Connection Issues
**Problem:** Drill loading shows "Loading drills..." indefinitely
**Cause:** The drills are fetching but categories were previously mapped incorrectly
**Fix Applied:** Updated `useDrills.ts` to use actual database categories
**Status:** Fixed in code, needs testing with live data

### 2. Test Environment Issues
**Problem:** Welcome modal blocks Playwright tests
**Location:** First visit to practice planner
**Workaround:** Tests need to handle modal dismissal
```javascript
// Add to test setup
if (await page.locator('.welcome-modal').isVisible()) {
  await page.locator('button:has-text("Skip")').click()
}
```

### 3. Duplicate Headers
**Problem:** Two h1 elements with "POWLAX Practice Planner"
**Impact:** Causes Playwright strict mode failures
**Solution:** Review and consolidate header elements

### 4. Save/Load with New Tables
**Issue:** `practice_plans` table has foreign key constraints
**Tables:** Requires valid user_id and team_id (UUIDs)
**Workaround:** Use `practice_plans_collaborative` table for testing

---

## üíª Quick Start for Next Agent

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Server is already running, but if needed:
npm run dev

# Run specific tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/practice-planner.spec.ts

# Check server status
lsof -ti:3000

# Validate code
npm run lint && npm run typecheck
```

### To Test Parallel Drills Visual
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/teams/1/practice-plans
2. Add multiple drills to practice
3. Look for "Add Another Parallel Activity" button
4. Verify lane indicators appear
5. Check responsive grid layout

### To Integrate Field Mode
```typescript
// In practice planner main component, add:
import FieldModeView from './FieldModeView'

// Add state
const [isFieldMode, setIsFieldMode] = useState(false)

// Add button
<Button onClick={() => setIsFieldMode(true)}>
  Enter Field Mode
</Button>

// Conditionally render
{isFieldMode ? (
  <FieldModeView 
    timeSlots={timeSlots}
    practiceTitle={practiceTitle}
    onExit={() => setIsFieldMode(false)}
  />
) : (
  // Normal practice planner view
)}
```

## üöÄ Final Notes

The Practice Planner has evolved significantly with the completion of Phase 2 and initiation of Phase 3. The parallel drills visual implementation provides coaches with a clear way to see and manage concurrent activities, while the new field mode component (though not yet integrated) offers a mobile-optimized experience for running practices on the field.

The system is stable and functional, with the main remaining work being the integration of field mode and addressing the minor issues identified during testing. The architecture is solid and ready for the next phase of development.
