# Lacrosse Knowledge Mapping Guide
*Building the Ultimate Connection System for POWLAX*

## Overview

This guide outlines a systematic approach to mapping the complete lacrosse knowledge base, creating deep connections between game phases, strategies, concepts, skills, and meta-skills. The goal is to build a comprehensive relational structure that mirrors how lacrosse is actually played, taught, and mastered.

## Part 1: Game Flow Analysis Framework

### Phase-Based Questionnaire System

#### 1. Transition Phases
- **Defensive Transition (Dead → Defense)**
  - What triggers this phase?
  - Player responsibilities by position
  - Communication calls used
  - Common strategies employed
  - Decision points and reads

- **Offensive Transition (Defense → Offense)**
  - Recognition cues
  - Clearing patterns
  - Position-specific roles
  - Communication hierarchy
  - Strategy variations

#### 2. Settled Phases
- **Settled Offense**
  - Formation recognition (1-4-1, 2-2-2, 3-1-2, 2-1-3, 21-12 Motion)
  - Player responsibilities within each set
  - Concept execution timing
  - Communication patterns
  - Meta-strategy connections

- **Settled Defense**
  - Defensive sets and slides
  - Help responsibilities
  - Communication priorities
  - Pressure points
  - Recovery patterns

#### 3. Special Situations
- **Man-Up/Man-Down**
- **Face-offs**
- **Rides/Clears**
- **End-game scenarios**

### Key Questions for Each Phase:
1. What visual cues trigger phase recognition?
2. What are the primary communication calls?
3. How do responsibilities shift by position?
4. What strategies are most commonly employed?
5. What concepts underpin each strategy?
6. What skills are essential for execution?
7. What meta-skills connect everything?

- Written descriptions
- Video explanations
- Progression sequences
- Skill connections

### Parsing Framework

```yaml

    - Formation descriptions
    - Execution steps
    
  Concept Identification:
    - Core concepts within strategies
    - Decision frameworks
    - Recognition patterns
    - Execution principles
    
  Skill Mapping:
    - Technical skills required
    - Positional skills
    - Communication skills
    - Meta-skills
    
  Connection Discovery:
    - Strategy → Concept links
    - Concept → Skill requirements
    - Skill → Drill applications
    - Cross-phase relationships
```

## Part 3: Decision Framework Structure

### "What Did You See?" → "What Should You Do?" Model

#### Recognition Layer
1. **Visual Cues**
   - Defensive positioning
   - Offensive formation
   - Space availability
   - Player movement patterns

2. **Situational Context**
   - Game phase
   - Score/time factors
   - Personnel matchups
   - Field position

#### Response Layer
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Individual techniques
   - Communication calls
   - Movement decisions

2. **Strategic Choices**
   - Play selection
   - Formation adjustments
   - Tempo changes

## Part 4: Specialized Agent System

### Agent 1: Concept Connection Scout
```yaml
Role: Identify and map conceptual relationships
Focus Areas:
  - Strategy → Concept bridges
  - Cross-phase concept applications
  - Conceptual prerequisites
  - Meta-concept patterns
```

### Agent 2: Situation Analyst
```yaml
Role: Map situational decision trees
Focus Areas:
  - Game situation categorization
  - Decision point identification
  - Outcome tracking
  - Pattern recognition
```

### Agent 3: Skill Link Builder
```yaml
Role: Connect skills to applications
Focus Areas:
  - Skill → Drill mappings
  - Skill progression paths
  - Cross-skill dependencies
  - Meta-skill identification
```

### Agent 4: Coaching Insight Harvester
```yaml
Role: Extract coaching wisdom from live observations
Focus Areas:
  - Real-time decision rationale
  - Teaching cue extraction
  - Common mistake patterns
  - Correction strategies
```

## Part 5: Five Table Connection Strategies

### 1. **Hierarchical Phase-Based Architecture**
```sql
Tables:
- game_phases (transition_offense, settled_offense, etc.)
- strategies (parent: game_phase)
- concepts (parent: strategies)
- skills (many-to-many with concepts)
- drills (many-to-many with skills)
- meta_skills (cross-table connections)

Key Feature: Natural game flow hierarchy with meta-skill overlay
```

### 2. **Decision Tree Network**
```sql
Tables:
- situations (game context + visual cues)
- decision_points (what did you see?)
- responses (what should you do?)
- required_skills (for each response)
- teaching_progressions (skill development paths)

Key Feature: Mirrors actual in-game decision making
```

### 3. **Concept-Centric Web**
```sql
Tables:
- core_concepts (fundamental principles)
- concept_applications (where/how used)
- strategy_concepts (strategy-specific implementations)
- skill_requirements (per concept)
- drill_demonstrations (concept teaching tools)

Key Feature: Concepts as the central organizing principle
```

### 4. **Coach's Playbook Model**
```sql
Tables:
- offensive_sets (formations + variations)
- defensive_schemes (slides + recoveries)
- transition_patterns (clearing/riding)
- situational_plays (special teams)
- skill_emphasis (per play/pattern)
- teaching_points (coaching cues)

Key Feature: Organized like an actual coaching playbook
```

### 5. **Progressive Learning Path**
```sql
Tables:
- learning_stages (beginner → advanced)
- skill_progressions (building blocks)
- concept_introductions (when to teach what)
- drill_sequences (ordered by complexity)
- assessment_checkpoints (mastery indicators)
- meta_connections (cross-stage relationships)

Key Feature: Optimized for player development journey
```

## Meta-Skills Framework

### Identified Meta-Skills (To Be Expanded)
1. **Spatial Awareness** - Connects all phases
2. **Communication Leadership** - Crosses all positions
3. **Decision Speed** - Critical in transitions
4. **Pattern Recognition** - Enables strategic thinking
5. **Adaptability** - Allows style flexibility

### Meta-Skill Mapping Process
1. Identify skills that appear across multiple contexts
2. Analyze their role in connecting concepts
3. Create cross-reference tables
4. Build progression paths
5. Link to assessment methods
