## Strategic Rationale

Per Hormozi principle: "Solve rich people problems... they pay more."

Our true customers are **coaches and directors** who control team budgets. Free individual access cannibalizes the perceived value of our enterprise products (Team HQ and Club OS).

### Value Stack Impact

By charging $9.99/month for Basic:
- Each Team HQ saves families $120/year per player
- Directors can justify investment: "We're saving each family $10/month"
- Creates clear ROI narrative for decision makers
