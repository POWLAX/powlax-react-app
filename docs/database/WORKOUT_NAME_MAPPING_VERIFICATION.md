## ‚úÖ **READY FOR SQL UPDATE**

Most mappings are clear and ready to use. Please review:

1. **Defense 9 & 11** - Should we use the truncated titles or find complete versions?
2. **Wall Ball variants** - Coaching vs No-Coaching versions preference?

Once confirmed, I can update the SQL script with the correct workout title mappings!
