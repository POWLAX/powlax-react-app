## 🔍 **VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

### **✅ Before Running SQL:**
- [ ] **Check workout names** - Ensure CSV workout names match database workout titles
- [ ] **Verify drill counts** - Confirm drill_count matches actual number of drills per workout
- [ ] **Sequence validation** - Check that sequence_order starts at 1 and increments properly
- [ ] **Drill name consistency** - Ensure drill names match skills_academy_drills table entries

### **✅ After Running SQL:**
- [ ] **Count verification** - Total drill-workout relationships should be 431
- [ ] **Workout coverage** - All 34 workouts should have drill_ids populated
- [ ] **Sequence order** - drill_ids arrays should be ordered by sequence_order
- [ ] **No missing drills** - All drills in CSV should map to database drill IDs
