## üìù Contract Execution Notes

This specification is designed for execution using the Claude-to-Claude Sub-Agent Framework. Each section can be assigned to specialized agents:

1. **Frontend Development Agent**: Dashboard UI components
2. **Backend Architecture Agent**: Data models and API design
3. **UX Research Agent**: Age-appropriate adaptations validation
4. **Mobile Optimization Agent**: Field-usage optimizations
5. **Integration Agent**: System connectivity and data flow

Success criteria are measurable and time-bound, allowing for clear progress tracking and quality assurance throughout the implementation process.
