## Questions to Address

1. **Team Migrations**
   - Are all WordPress team relationships preserved?
   - How do we handle orphaned data?
   - What's the rollback plan if issues arise?

2. **Content Editor**
   - Who should have edit permissions?
   - Do we need version history?
   - Should changes require approval?

3. **Skills Academy**
   - How many workouts from the original app?
   - What's the progression logic?
   - How do prerequisites work?

4. **Navigation**
   - What's the ideal menu structure?
   - How do we handle role-based navigation?
   - Mobile vs desktop navigation differences?

## Notes for Development

- **Use TypeScript** for all new components
- **Follow existing patterns** in the codebase
- **Test on mobile** - this is a mobile-first app
- **Document as you go** - update this file with progress
- **Commit frequently** with clear messages
- **Ask questions** if requirements are unclear
