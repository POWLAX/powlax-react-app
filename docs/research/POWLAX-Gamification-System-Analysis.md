# POWLAX Online Skills Academy Gamification System Analysis

## üìä Current System Synthesis

### **Existing Gamification Architecture**

#### **Point Systems:**
- **Workout Points**: 5 points (5 drills), 10 points (10 drills), 15 points (15 drills)
- **Position-Specific Tokens**:
  - Defense Dollars (defensive workouts)
  - Attack Tokens (attack workouts) 
  - Midfield Medals (midfield workouts)
  - Rebound Rewards (wall ball workouts)
- **Universal Currency**: Lax Credits (earned proportionally with position tokens)

#### **Badge System:**
- **Badge Types**: Attack, Defense, Midfield, Wall Ball, Solid Start (beginners), Lacrosse IQ
- **Earning Mechanism**: Complete 5 workouts in specific area = badge earned
- **Current Problem**: Any workout length counts equally (5 short workouts = badge)

#### **Ranking System:**
- **Lacrosse Player Ranks**: Based on accumulated Lax Credits
- **Lax IQ Points**: Knowledge check/quiz completion rewards (underutilized)
- **Flex Points**: External practice logging (non-academy workouts)

#### **Knowledge Integration:**
- **Quiz Badges**: Immediate badge award upon quiz completion
- **Video Engagement**: Potential for tracking video completion

## üéØ Identified System Problems

### **Current Issues:**
1. **Badge Gaming**: 5 short workouts = same badge as 5 comprehensive workouts
2. **Disconnected Systems**: Badges and ranks operate independently  
3. **Underutilized IQ System**: Quiz/knowledge rewards not integrated
4. **Limited Progression**: No difficulty scaling or advanced challenges
5. **Coach Integration Gap**: No position assignment or team evaluation tools
6. **Parent Engagement**: Minimal parent notification/involvement features

### **Enhancement Opportunities:**
1. **Coach Position Management**: Assign player positions, track team averages
2. **Streak Systems**: Daily, weekly, monthly engagement tracking
3. **Progressive Difficulty**: Reward harder workouts more heavily
4. **Parent Dashboard**: Real-time achievement notifications
5. **Team Competition**: Position-based team challenges

## üìà Data Migration Requirements

### **Supabase Table Schema Needs:**

#### **Badges Table**
```sql
badges (
  id: uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  badge_type: text (attack, defense, midfield, wallball, solidstart, lacrosseiq),
  title: text,
  description: text,
  image_url: text,
  featured_image_url: text,
  congratulations_text: text,
  requirements: jsonb, -- New: flexible requirement system
  point_value: integer,
  created_at: timestamp
)
```

#### **Player Progress Table**
```sql
player_progress (
  id: uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  player_id: uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  badge_id: uuid REFERENCES badges(id),
  progress: integer, -- Workouts completed toward badge
  completed: boolean,
  completion_date: timestamp,
  workout_data: jsonb -- Track workout types/lengths
)
```

#### **Gamification Points Table**
```sql
gamification_points (
  id: uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  player_id: uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  point_type: text (lax_credits, defense_dollars, attack_tokens, etc.),
  amount: integer,
  earned_from: text, -- workout_id, quiz_id, etc.
  earned_date: timestamp,
  metadata: jsonb
)
```

#### **Player Ranks Table**
```sql
player_ranks (
  id: uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  player_id: uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  rank_name: text,
  rank_level: integer,
  lax_credits_required: integer,
  achieved_date: timestamp,
  rank_image_url: text
)
```

#### **Streaks Tracking Table**
```sql
player_streaks (
  id: uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  player_id: uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  streak_type: text (daily, weekly, monthly),
  current_streak: integer,
  best_streak: integer,
  last_activity_date: date,
  streak_data: jsonb
)
```

## ‚ùì Clarification Questions

### **Data Structure Confirmations:**
1. **Badge Requirements**: Should we maintain the "5 workouts = badge" system or implement weighted requirements?
2. **Workout Categorization**: How do we want to weight Mini (5) vs More (10) vs Complete (14-18) workouts?
3. **Quiz Integration**: Should quiz badges be separate from workout badges or integrated?
4. **Parent Notifications**: What specific achievements should trigger parent alerts?
5. **Coach Dashboard**: What team metrics are most important for coach evaluation?

### **Technical Considerations:**
1. **Real-time Updates**: Should achievements be awarded immediately or in batches?
2. **Offline Tracking**: How should we handle workouts completed offline?
3. **Data Retention**: How long should we keep detailed workout history?
4. **Privacy Controls**: What gamification data should parents/coaches see vs. player-only?
