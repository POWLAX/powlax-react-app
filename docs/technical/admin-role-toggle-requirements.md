# Admin Role Toggle Feature Requirements

## 📋 Overview
Create a persistent menu bar that allows administrators to temporarily view the application as different user roles for testing and support purposes.

## 🎯 Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Persistent Toggle Bar**: Always visible when admin is logged in
2. **Role Options**: 
   - View as Director (with org selection)
   - View as Coach (with team selection)
   - View as Player (with player selection)
   - View as Parent (with parent selection)
   - Return to Admin view
3. **Context Preservation**: Remember selected context (org/team/player) during session
4. **Visual Indicator**: Clear indication when viewing as another role
5. **Quick Switch**: One-click return to admin view

### Technical Requirements
1. **State Management**: Global state for active viewing role
2. **API Override**: Modify API calls to respect viewing role
3. **UI Updates**: All components respect the viewing role
4. **Security**: Actual permissions remain admin-level (read-only simulation)
5. **Audit Trail**: Log when admin views as other roles

## 🤝 Coordination Needed

### With UX Expert (🎨)
- Design mockups for the toggle bar
- Color scheme to indicate active viewing mode
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet
- Animation/transition effects
- Icon design for each role

### With Dev Team (💻)
- Implementation of global state management
- API request interceptors
- Component updates to respect viewing role
- Security validation

### Example UI Concept
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 👁️ Admin View Mode: [Viewing as Coach - Team Eagles]  [Exit] 🔴 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### State Structure
```typescript
interface AdminViewingState {
  isViewingAs: boolean;
  viewingRole: 'admin' | 'director' | 'coach' | 'player' | 'parent';
  viewingContext: {
    organizationId?: string;
    teamId?: string;
    userId?: string;
  };
  actualUser: User; // Preserve admin user
  simulatedUser: User; // Simulated user data
}
```

### Security Considerations
- All write operations should be blocked in viewing mode
- Clear visual indicators prevent confusion
- Automatic timeout after 30 minutes
- Audit log entries for compliance

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. UX Expert creates design mockups
2. Review with admin user for feedback
3. Implement state management layer
4. Add toggle bar component
5. Update all data queries to respect viewing mode

**Priority**: Medium (helpful for testing but not blocking core functionality)
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days with UX design + implementation
