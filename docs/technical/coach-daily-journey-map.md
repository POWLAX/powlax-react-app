## ðŸ”¥ The "Aha!" Moment

**Tuesday, 4:15 PM - Two weeks into using POWLAX**

Sarah is running the "Triangle Passing" drill. A player asks, "Coach, why do we do this drill so much?"

Sarah pulls out her phone, shows the drill card:
- **Strategy**: 2-3-1 Motion Offense
- **Skill**: Off-ball movement
- **Why**: Creates space for cutters

"See? This drill teaches the exact movement you need for our offense. When we run 2-3-1 in the game Saturday, you'll understand your role!"

The players nod, understanding dawning. They attack the drill with new purpose.

**This is why POWLAX exists.**
