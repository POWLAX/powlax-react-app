### 🚧 Current Challenge: Missing Database Tables

**Critical Issue**: The security policies and data access patterns reference tables that don't exist yet.

**Existing Tables** (from migrations):
- ✅ `users` (WordPress sync)
- ✅ `user_subscriptions` (WordPress sync)
- ✅ `user_sessions`
- ✅ `user_activity_log`
- ✅ `staging_wp_*` tables (temporary import tables)

**Missing Core Tables**:
- ❌ `organizations`
- ❌ `teams`
- ❌ `team_members`
- ❌ `parent_child_relationships`
- ❌ `practice_plans`
- ❌ `drills` (production version)
- ❌ `strategies`
- ❌ `concepts`
- ❌ `skills`
- ❌ All taxonomy tables

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. **Create Core Database Tables** 🔴 CRITICAL
Using the V3 Supabase schema reference (`/docs/existing/v3-supabase-tables-list.md`), create migrations for:

#### Phase 1: Organization & Team Structure
```sql
-- Organizations (foundation for multi-tenancy)
-- Teams (with proper age_band references)
-- Team Members (player/coach/parent relationships)
-- Parent-Child Relationships
```

#### Phase 2: Core Content Tables
```sql
-- Drills (Section 1, Table 1 from V3 schema)
-- Strategies (Section 1, Table 3)
-- Concepts (Section 1, Table 4)
-- Skills (Section 2, Table 7 - including meta-skills)
```

#### Phase 3: Taxonomy Foundation
```sql
-- Game Phases (Section 2, Table 6)
-- Age Bands (Section 4, Table 21)
-- Player Situations (Section 2, Table 8)
```

### 2. **Data Migration from Staging** 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY
- Migrate data from `staging_wp_drills` to production `drills` table
- Establish drill→strategy→concept→skill relationships
- Import WordPress user data into proper team structures

### 3. **Fix Security Policies** 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY
- Update migration `003_enhanced_security_policies.sql` to work with actual tables
- Test RLS policies with each role type
- Verify organization and team boundaries

## 🚀 Available Work Branches

Based on my initial assessment, here are the paths we can take:

### Branch A: **Database Foundation** (Recommended First)
1. Create production tables from V3 schema
2. Establish proper foreign key relationships
3. Migrate staging data to production
4. Test security policies

### Branch B: **Complete Dashboard Implementation**
- Requires Branch A first
- Implement real data fetching in dashboards
- Add analytics and metrics
- Create role-specific features

### Branch C: **Practice Planner Integration**
- Connect existing practice planner to Supabase
- Implement drill library with security
- Add strategy/concept filtering
- Enable practice saving/loading

### Branch D: **Skills Academy Foundation**
- Create workout and academy drill structures
- Implement progress tracking
- Add badge/point system
- Build player dashboard features

### Branch E: **Team Management System**
- Team creation and roster management
- Coach assignment workflows
- Parent-child linking interface
- Team communication features

### Branch F: **WordPress Sync Enhancement**
- Automated user sync from WordPress

## 🔧 Technical Decisions Needed

### 1. **Table Creation Approach**
- [ ] Create all tables at once?
- [ ] Phased approach by feature?
- [ ] How closely to follow V3 schema?

### 2. **Data Migration Strategy**
- [ ] Direct SQL migrations?
- [ ] Script-based with validation?
- [ ] Keep staging tables as backup?

### 3. **ID Strategy**
- [ ] Use V3 schema ID patterns (D001, S001)?
- [ ] Use UUIDs throughout?
- [ ] Hybrid approach?

### 4. **Relationship Management**
- [ ] Use junction tables for many-to-many?
- [ ] PostgreSQL arrays for simple relationships?
- [ ] Both depending on use case?

## 🤝 Coordination Notes

### For Next Session:
1. **Recommended Agent**: @Winston (Architect) to design table creation strategy
2. **Alternative**: @Dev to implement table migrations
3. **Context to Include**: This document + V3 schema reference
4. **Decision Needed**: Which branch to pursue first

### Key Files to Reference:
- `/docs/existing/v3-supabase-tables-list.md` - Complete schema reference
- `/docs/technical/security-architecture.md` - Security requirements
- `/docs/technical/data-access-security-plan.md` - Access patterns
- `/supabase/migrations/` - Existing migrations

### Critical Reminder:
**Security First**: Every new table must have appropriate RLS policies before any data is inserted.

## 📝 Notes for Admin

The security architecture is ready, but without the underlying tables, it's like having a beautiful house blueprint with no foundation. The V3 schema document provides exact table structures, but we need to decide:

1. How faithfully to implement the V3 schema
2. Whether to simplify some relationships
3. If we need all tables immediately or can phase them

The good news: Once tables exist, all the security and dashboard work will immediately function properly.
