# POWLAX Gamification System Explainer

## 🎯 The Problem We Solved

**Old System Exploit:**
- Players earned badges by completing 5 easy workouts
- No difference between easy and hard drills
- Encouraged "gaming" rather than skill development

**New Anti-Gaming System:**
- Points = Number of Drills × Average Difficulty (1-5)
- Hard workouts worth exponentially more than easy ones
- Badges require accumulated points, not workout count

## 📊 How Points Are Calculated

### Base Formula
```
Points = Drill Count × Average Difficulty Score
```

### Example Calculations
- **Easy Workout**: 5 drills × 1.0 difficulty = **5 points**
- **Medium Workout**: 4 drills × 3.0 difficulty = **12 points**  
- **Hard Workout**: 3 drills × 4.5 difficulty = **14 points**

### Bonus Multipliers
- **Streak Bonus**: 
  - 7+ days = +15%
  - 30+ days = +30%
  - 100+ days = +50%
- **Difficulty Bonus**:
  - Average 3.5+ = +25%
  - Average 4.0+ = +50%
- **First Today**: +10% for daily habit

### Point Categories
Each drill awards points based on its type:

| Category | Icon | Earned From |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Lax Credits** | 💰 | All drills (universal currency) |
| **Attack Tokens** | ⚔️ | Offensive drills, shooting |
| **Defense Dollars** | 🛡️ | Defensive drills, footwork |
| **Midfield Medals** | 🏃 | Transition, ground balls |
| **Rebound Rewards** | 🎯 | Wall ball workouts |
| **Lax IQ Points** | 🧠 | Strategy, film study |

## 🔐 Workout Verification

### Current System
1. User selects drills from library
2. User starts workout (timer begins for reference)
3. User completes drills at their pace
4. User clicks "Complete Workout"
5. **Server calculates points** (no client-side manipulation)
6. Points awarded and streak updated

### Why No Time-Based Points?
- Prevents leaving app open to accumulate time
- Focuses on quality over duration
- Accommodates different skill levels
- Some drills naturally take longer

### Anti-Cheating Measures
- ✅ All calculations server-side only
- ✅ Difficulty scores locked in database
- ✅ Transaction logs for audit trail
- ✅ Anomaly detection for suspicious patterns
- ✅ Daily workout limits (coming soon)

### Future Enhancements
- 🔮 Vimeo video completion tracking
- 🔮 Coach verification for team workouts
- 🔮 Motion detection via camera
- 🔮 Heart rate monitor integration

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I still get badges with easy workouts?**
A: Yes, but it takes MANY more easy workouts. A badge that used to take 5 easy workouts now requires ~50.

**Q: What if I miss a day?**
A: You have 2 "streak freezes" that automatically protect your streak for up to 3 missed days.

**Q: Do longer workouts give more points?**
A: No, points are based on drill count × difficulty, not time. Quality over quantity!

**Q: Can I repeat the same drill for points?**
A: Yes, but daily limits prevent spam. Focus on variety for best results.

**Q: How do I maximize points?**
A: 
1. Choose drills at your skill level (3-4 difficulty)
2. Maintain daily streaks
3. Mix categories for balanced development
4. Complete "gatekeeper" challenge drills for elite badges
