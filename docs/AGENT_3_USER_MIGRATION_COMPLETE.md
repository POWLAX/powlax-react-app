## 📊 Data Analysis Results

### WordPress Users Identified
- **Total Users:** 1 active user
- **Primary User:** Patrick Chapla (WordPress ID: 1)
  - Email: patrick@powlax.com
  - Generated UUID: `b23f19a5-4daf-42b8-9148-492a72a139b0`
  - Points Balance: 150 Lax IQ Points

### Data Sources Successfully Processed
- **Lax-IQ-Points-Export:** 22 point records → 1 user with 150 points
- **Completed-Workouts-Export:** Ready for badge mapping
- **Lacrosse-Player-Ranks-Export:** Ready for rank assignment

## 🏗️ Database Schema Compatibility

All scripts updated to work with the actual gamification schema:
- ✅ `user_points_wallets` (not `user_points_balance`)
- ✅ `user_points_ledger` (not `points_transactions`) 
- ✅ `user_badges` (not `user_badge_progress`)
- ✅ `user_ranks` (not `user_rank_progress`)

## ⚠️ Dependency Status

**Current Blocker:** Foreign key constraint requires users to exist in `users` table first.

**Resolution Required:** User profiles must be synced from WordPress before running these migrations.

## 🚀 Execution Instructions

Once user profiles are available in the `users` table:

```bash
# Run migrations in sequence
npx tsx scripts/migrate-user-points.ts
npx tsx scripts/migrate-user-badges.ts  
npx tsx scripts/migrate-user-ranks.ts
```

## 🔄 Integration Points

These scripts work with:
- **Agent 1:** Point types and definitions
- **Agent 2:** Badge definitions and requirements
- **Future User Sync:** WordPress to Supabase user migration

## 📋 Data Mapping Summary

### Points System
- WordPress Lax IQ Points → Supabase `lax_iq_points` currency
- Point balances preserved with full audit trail
- Transaction history created for migration baseline

### Badge System  
- Workout completions → Badge progress tracking
- Pattern matching for badge categories:
  - 5/10/15 drill workouts → Completion badges
  - Wall ball activities → Wall ball badges  
  - Position-specific training → Attack/Defense/Midfield badges

### Rank System
- Point-based rank progression:
  - 0 pts: Lacrosse Bot
  - 25+ pts: 2nd Bar Syndrome  
  - 60+ pts: Left Bench Hero
  - 100+ pts: Celly King
  - (Progressive system up to Lax Legend at 1000+ pts)

## ✅ Quality Assurance

- ✅ All scripts include comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Batch processing for database efficiency  
- ✅ Deterministic UUID generation for consistency
- ✅ Progress logging and debugging capabilities
- ✅ Data validation and transformation verification
- ✅ Export capabilities for cross-agent coordination
