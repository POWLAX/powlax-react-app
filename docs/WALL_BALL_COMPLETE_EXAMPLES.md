### How Drill Assignment Works:
- **If a cell has a NUMBER**: That drill is in that workout at that sequence position
- **If a cell is EMPTY**: That drill is NOT in that workout
- **The NUMBER is the sequence order**: 1 = first, 2 = second, etc.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS

### About "Master Fund" Question:
You asked where I was seeing "Master Fund" - I was incorrectly abbreviating the column header. The ACTUAL column headers are:
- **Column E**: "Master Fundamentals" (NOT "Master Fund")
- **Column F**: "10 Master Fund" (this one IS abbreviated in the CSV)
- **Column G**: "5 Minute Master Fundamentals" (full name)

### Key Points:
1. **Each workout is a SINGLE VIDEO** - The drill sequence just shows what's demonstrated in that video
2. **The numbers in cells are sequence positions** - Not drill IDs
3. **Empty cells mean that drill is NOT in that workout**
4. **Column headers are the exact workout names** - Use them as-is for database
