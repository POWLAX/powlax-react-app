## 🔍 Badge Requirements Analysis

### Workout Requirements Extracted
- **Most badges**: Require 5 workout completions
- **Solid Start badges**: Require 3 workout completions
- **Master badges** (like "Wall Ball Wizard"): Special compound requirements

### Point System Integration
- Each category has specific point types:
  - Attack: `attack-token`, `crease-crawler-coin`, etc.
  - Defense: `hip-hitter-workout`, `slide-master-points`, etc.
  - Wall Ball: `foundation-ace-coin`, `finishing-phenom-wor`, etc.
  - Solid Start: `solid-start-points`, etc.
  - Lacrosse IQ: Category-based point types

### Quiz Integration Discovered
- 167 unique quiz IDs extracted across all badges
- Quizzes represent the actual workout completion mechanism
- Badge earning tied to quiz completion rather than direct point accumulation
