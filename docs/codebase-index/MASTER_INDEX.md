### Unused/Orphaned Tables
Tables that exist in database but have no code references:
- **registration_sessions** (0 records) - Empty table, no usage found
- **family_members** (2 records) - No active code usage despite having data
- **user_rank_progress** (null records) - Empty table with no usage
- **playbook_drills** (null records) - Empty table with no usage  
- **playbook_strategies** (null records) - Empty table with no usage

### Phase 2 Tables (Planned Features)
Tables referenced for future self-contained payment system:
- **user_subscriptions** - !IMPORTANT - SELF-CONTAINED PAYMENT SYSTEM ONLY!
- **payment_products** - Internal product catalog (no MemberPress API calls)
- **stripe_customers** - Direct Stripe integration (no WordPress dependency)
- **user_points_wallets** - Replaced by `user_points_balance_powlax` (table exists)

#### Array-Based Relationships
Skills Academy uses `drill_ids` array columns instead of junction tables:
```sql
-- skills_academy_workouts table
drill_ids: integer[] -- References skills_academy_drills.id
```

#### Source Separation
Clear distinction between official and user-generated content:
- `powlax_*` tables - Official POWLAX content (drills, strategies)
- `user_*` tables - User-created content with sharing capabilities

#### Organizational Hierarchy
```
clubs (organizations) 
  → teams 
    → team_members 
      → users
```

## Critical Issues Requiring Attention

### 1. Database Schema Status (FUNCTIONAL)
- **Core Tables:** 29 tables exist and function correctly for current features
- **Phase 2 Tables:** 6 tables planned for WordPress/MemberPress integration:
  - `user_team_roles`, `membership_entitlements`, `membership_products` (MemberPress)
  - `webhook_events`, `data_access_audit` (Audit logging)
  - `user_points_wallets` (replaced by `user_points_balance_powlax`)
- **Impact:** All current features work; Phase 2 features will require additional tables
- **Status:** ✅ Core functionality complete, expansion tables documented for Phase 2

### 2. Authentication System (INTENTIONALLY MOCKED)
- **Current State:** Mock authentication per documented development strategy
- **Purpose:** Enable rapid development without auth complexity barriers
- **Documentation:** See `COMPLETE_AUTH_REMOVAL_SUCCESS.md` for full context
- **Impact:** All features testable with admin-level demo user
- **Status:** ✅ Working as designed for development phase
- **Next Phase:** !IMPORTANT - SUPABASE AUTH ONLY! Self-contained system with Stripe payments. NO WordPress integration!

### 3. Development APIs (FUNCTIONAL FOR CURRENT PHASE)
- **Email Service:** Development implementation for magic link authentication
  - !IMPORTANT - NO WORDPRESS EMAIL INTEGRATION PLANNED!
- **Payment APIs:** Development endpoints for self-contained payment system
  - !IMPORTANT - STRIPE/PAYPAL INTEGRATION ONLY! No MemberPress API calls planned!
- **Workout APIs:** Production-ready with full gamification and database operations
- **Impact:** All APIs support current development and testing needs
- **Status:** ✅ Functional for development, Phase 2 will add Stripe/PayPal integration (!IMPORTANT - NO WORDPRESS APIS!)
