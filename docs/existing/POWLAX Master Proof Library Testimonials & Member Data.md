POWLAX Master Proof Library
A single, quick-grab reference of every testimonial (with exact + condensed versions) and all
data-driven trust snippets. Copy-paste any block into a page, deck, email, or ad without
hunting.
Usage rule of thumb: Reach for the Exact quote ~80 % of the time to keep authenticity and
compliance airtight. Use the Synthesized pull quote only when it crisply reinforces the point
and space or tone demands brevity (e.g., ad headlines, tight hero space). Always keep a footnote
or hover-tooltip that links back to the full Exact quote.
