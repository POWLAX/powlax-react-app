## üìö Required Reading Before Planning

### **Primary Specifications**
1. `docs/existing/Gamification/Gemini Gamification for POWLAX.md` - Comprehensive 183-line implementation blueprint

## üìã Implementation Framework (3-Phase System)

### **Phase 1: Anti-Gaming Foundation (1-2 weeks)**
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Stops current system exploitation
**Key Elements**:
- Difficulty Scores (DS 1-5) for every drill
- Effort-based point calculation: `Points = Drills √ó Average Difficulty`
- Badge requirements shift from workout count to accumulated points
- Streak mechanics (Duolingo-inspired)
- Basic parent notifications ("Weekly Hustle")

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Progression (1-2 months)**  
**Priority**: HIGH - Deepens engagement
**Key Elements**:
- Tiered badge system (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum)
- Player attribute visualization ("MyPlayer" concept)
- Team leaderboards and coach dashboard v1
- Daily & weekly challenges (Fortnite-inspired)

### **Phase 3: Advanced Community (3-6 months)**
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Long-term retention
**Key Elements**:
- Seasonal content & "Lax Pass" system
- Competitive leagues (division-based)
- Player-created challenges
- Advanced personalization

## üîß Technical Elements to Manipulate

### **Database Schema Requirements**
```sql
-- Phase 1 Requirements
ALTER TABLE drills ADD COLUMN difficulty_score INTEGER CHECK (difficulty_score BETWEEN 1 AND 5);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN current_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN longest_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN last_activity_date DATE;

-- Badge System Restructure
ALTER TABLE badges ADD COLUMN badge_level VARCHAR(20); -- Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum
ALTER TABLE user_badges ADD COLUMN progress_towards_next INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```

### **React Components to Create**
```typescript
// Core gamification components
components/gamification/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ StreakCounter.tsx           // Visual streak display
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DifficultyIndicator.tsx     // Drill difficulty stars/bars
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ProgressBar.tsx             // Badge progression visual
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PlayerAttributeCard.tsx     // MyPlayer stats display
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LeaderboardWidget.tsx       // Team ranking display
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DailyChallengeCard.tsx      // Challenge display
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ParentWeeklyReport.tsx      // Parent notification component
```

### **Point Calculation Logic**
```typescript
// New workout scoring system
interface WorkoutScore {
  drills: Drill[]
  totalPoints: number
  averageDifficulty: number
  categoryPoints: {
    attackTokens: number
    defenseDollars: number
    midfieldMedals: number
    goalieGems: number
  }
}

function calculateWorkoutPoints(drills: Drill[]): WorkoutScore {
  const avgDifficulty = drills.reduce((sum, drill) => sum + drill.difficulty_score, 0) / drills.length
  const totalPoints = drills.length * avgDifficulty
  // Implementation follows Phase 1 specifications
}
```

## üö® Critical Anti-Gaming Requirements

1. **Server-Side Validation**: All point calculations MUST happen on backend
2. **Difficulty Enforcement**: Badge progress requires meeting difficulty thresholds
3. **Streak Protection**: Implement "freeze" mechanics to prevent burnout
4. **Gatekeeper Challenges**: Specific difficult drills required for tier advancement
5. **Social Balance**: Leaderboards focus on effort, not inherent skill

---

## ü§ù Agent Coordination Requirements

### **Breaking Changes Communication**
- **IMMEDIATELY** update `/tasks/coordination/agent-coordination-log.md` for:
  - New gamification UI components affecting frontend structure
  - Database schema requirements for badges, points, streaks
  - Changes to drill difficulty scoring that affect database queries
  - Major gamification features that need backend API updates

### **Daily Coordination Protocol**
```markdown
### **[YYYY-MM-DD] - Gamification Phase 1 Progress**
**From**: Gamification Implementation Architect  
**To**: Database Agent, Frontend Agent
**Type**: Update

**Files Affected**:
- `src/components/gamification/DifficultyScoring.tsx` - New difficulty UI component
- `src/lib/gamification/point-calculation.ts` - Point calculation logic
- `tasks/active/gamification/phase-1-anti-gaming-foundation.md` - Progress update

**Action Required**:
- [ ] Database: Create difficulty_scores table migration
- [ ] Frontend: Integrate new point display components
```

### **Phase Coordination Checklist**
- [ ] **Phase 1**: Coordinate difficulty scoring with database agent before UI implementation
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Ensure badge tier tables are created before implementing badge UI
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Coordinate leaderboard backend requirements before frontend development
- [ ] **Always**: Update agent status board when completing major phase milestones

### **Critical Coordination Points**
1. **With Database Agent**: All scoring calculations require backend validation
2. **With Frontend Agent**: Gamification UI components integrate with existing design system  
3. **With Testing**: Anti-gaming mechanics must be thoroughly validated

## üìù Documentation Standards

### **File References** (REQUIRED)
- ‚úÖ `docs/existing/Gamification/Gemini Gamification for POWLAX.md`
- ‚úÖ `tasks/active/gamification/phase-1-anti-gaming-foundation.md`
- ‚úÖ `src/components/gamification/BadgeSystem.tsx`
- ‚ùå "Gemini Gamification document" or file names without paths

Update progress in phase task files immediately when completing subtasks using relative file paths. Document all gamification component creations and coordinate timing with database schema changes through the agent coordination log.
