# 🎮 Skills Academy Master Coordination Plan
## Complete Implementation Strategy with Sub-Agent Orchestra

*Created: 2025-08-08*  
*Contract: skills-academy-complete-002*  
*Priority: CRITICAL*

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

The Skills Academy requires immediate attention to fix critical data connection issues and UI problems. This document outlines the complete coordination strategy for the POWLAX Master Controller to orchestrate sub-agents in fixing and completing the Skills Academy implementation.

### **Top 3 Critical Issues:**
1. ❌ **Drills show placeholder text** instead of real names
2. ❌ **Modals have dark backgrounds** (need white bg + dark text)  
3. ❌ **Data doesn't persist** (progress/points lost on refresh)

---

## 🎯 Master Controller Execution Plan

### **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Do First)**

```markdown
## Step 1: Contract Lock (5 minutes)
Master Controller presents to user:

"I've analyzed the Skills Academy issues. Here's what needs fixing:

CRITICAL FIXES:
1. Connect real drill data from database
2. Fix modal styling (white bg, dark text)
3. Save progress and points to database

ENHANCEMENTS:
4. Smooth workflow navigation
5. Loading states and error handling
6. Mobile optimization for field use

I'll coordinate our specialized agents to fix these in 3 phases:
- Phase 1: Data & Styling (4 hours)
- Phase 2: Workflow Integration (3 hours)  
- Phase 3: Polish & Gamification (2 hours)

Total time: ~9 hours of coordinated work

Do you approve this plan?"

## 🚀 Phase-by-Phase Execution

### **PHASE 1: Critical Fixes (Backend Focus)**
**Duration:** 4 hours  
**Lead Agent:** powlax-backend-architect

#### Master Controller Deployment Message:

```yaml
TO: powlax-backend-architect
TASK: Fix Skills Academy Data Foundation
CONTRACT: skills-academy-complete-002
PHASE: 1

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Fix Drill Data Connection:
   - File: src/hooks/useSkillsAcademyWorkouts.ts
   - Connect skills_academy_workout_drills to skills_academy_drill_library
   - Extract real drill names and Vimeo IDs
   - Test with workout IDs: 1, 2, 3, 4

2. Fix Modal Styling:
   - File: src/components/skills-academy/WorkoutSizeSelector.tsx
   - Change to white background (#FFFFFF)
   - Dark text (#1F2937, #4B5563, #6B7280)
   - Ensure readability (contrast > 7:1)

3. Implement Data Persistence:
   - Create API route: /api/workouts/progress
   - Save to: skills_academy_user_progress
   - Update: user_points_balance_powlax
   - Include completion timestamps

VALIDATION QUERIES:
```sql
-- Test drill data is connected
SELECT 
  wd.*, 
  d.drill_name,
  d.both_hands_vimeo_id
FROM skills_academy_workout_drills wd
JOIN skills_academy_drill_library d ON wd.drill_id = d.id
WHERE wd.workout_id = 1
ORDER BY wd.sequence_order;

-- Verify points update
SELECT * FROM user_points_balance_powlax 
WHERE user_id = 'test-user-id';
```

QUALITY GATES:
- npm run build must pass
- No console errors
- Modal screenshot shows white background
- Database queries return real data

RETURN FORMAT:
{
  "phase": 1,
  "tasksCompleted": {
    "drillData": true/false,
    "modalStyling": true/false,
    "persistence": true/false
  },
  "validation": {
    "buildPasses": true/false,
    "realDrillNames": ["Wall Ball Basic", "Quick Stick", ...],
    "modalScreenshot": "base64...",
    "dbTestResults": {}
  },
  "issues": [],
  "nextPhaseReady": true/false
}
```

#### Expected Response Evaluation:

```javascript
// Master Controller evaluates Phase 1 response
function evaluatePhase1(response) {
  const critical = [
    response.tasksCompleted.drillData,
    response.tasksCompleted.modalStyling,
    response.validation.buildPasses
  ];
  
  if (critical.every(Boolean)) {
    return { status: 'PROCEED_TO_PHASE_2' };
  } else {
    return { 
      status: 'ITERATE',
      fixes: critical.map((task, i) => 
        !task ? ['drillData', 'modalStyling', 'build'][i] : null
      ).filter(Boolean)
    };
  }
}
```

### **PHASE 2: Workflow Integration (Frontend Focus)**
**Duration:** 3 hours  
**Lead Agent:** powlax-frontend-developer

#### Master Controller Deployment Message:

```yaml
TO: powlax-frontend-developer
TASK: Integrate Skills Academy Workflow
CONTRACT: skills-academy-complete-002
PHASE: 2
DEPENDS_ON: Phase 1 Complete

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Connect Full User Flow:
   - From: SkillsAcademyHub.tsx
   - Through: WorkoutSizeSelector.tsx
   - To: /workout/[id]/page.tsx
   - Back: Completion returns to hub
   
2. Add Loading States:
   - Skeleton screens during data fetch
   - Error boundaries for failures
   - Retry buttons on errors
   
3. Progress Tracking UI:
   - Real-time progress bar updates
   - "Drill X of Y" counter
   - Timer display (MM:SS format)
   - Points accumulator

COMPONENT UPDATES:
```typescript
// SkillsAcademyHub.tsx - Add loading state
{loading ? (
  <SkeletonGrid count={6} />
) : (
  <SeriesGrid series={series} />
)}

// WorkoutSizeSelector.tsx - Ensure modal behavior
const handleSelectWorkout = (workout) => {
  onClose(); // Close modal first
  router.push(`/skills-academy/workout/${workout.id}`);
};

// workout/[id]/page.tsx - Add completion redirect
const handleWorkoutComplete = () => {
  saveProgress();
  router.push('/skills-academy?completed=true');
};
```

MOBILE REQUIREMENTS:
- Touch targets: minimum 60px
- Swipe gestures for drill navigation
- High contrast for outdoor visibility
- Portrait orientation lock

QUALITY GATES:
- Full flow works without page refresh
