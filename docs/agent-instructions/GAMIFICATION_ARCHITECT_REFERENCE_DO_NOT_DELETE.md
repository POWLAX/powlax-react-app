## 🤖 Agent Note to Self

When you return to this project, start here. This is your checkpoint for what was accomplished and what needs to be done next.

## 📊 Current Status Summary

### ✅ Phase 1: Anti-Gaming Foundation - COMPLETE

Successfully implemented the core anti-gaming mechanisms to prevent players from earning badges with minimal effort workouts.

**Key Achievement**: Transformed the system from quantity-based (5 easy workouts = badge) to quality-based (Points = Drills × Difficulty).

### 🗂️ Where Everything Lives

#### Core Implementation Files
```
/src/lib/gamification/
  ├── point-calculator.ts      ← Core scoring logic
  ├── streak-manager.ts        ← Streak tracking system
  └── __tests__/               ← Test suite

/src/components/gamification/
  ├── DifficultyIndicator.tsx  ← Visual difficulty display
  └── StreakCounter.tsx        ← Streak visualization

/src/app/api/workouts/complete/route.ts ← Secure API endpoint
```

#### Database Migrations (Run in order)

- `/gamification-demo` - Full interactive demo

### 🚀 Quick Start When Returning

1. **Check deployment status**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-phase1-gamification.sh
   ```

2. **Test the system**:
   - Visit `/test-gamification` to see it working
   - Check if migrations have been run

3. **Resume work**:
   - If Phase 1 deployed → Start Phase 2 (see below)
   - If not deployed → Run deployment script first

### 📋 Next Phase Ready to Implement

**Phase 2: Enhanced Engagement** (`/tasks/gamification/phase-2-enhanced-engagement.md`)
- Tiered badges (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum)
- MyPlayer attribute visualization
- Team leaderboards
- Daily/weekly challenges

### 🔑 Key Formulas to Remember

1. **Point Calculation**:
   ```
   Points = Number of Drills × Average Difficulty (1-5)
   ```

2. **Bonus Multipliers**:
   - Streak: 7+ days = 15%, 30+ days = 30%
   - Difficulty: Avg 4.0+ = 50% bonus
   - First today: 10% bonus

3. **Badge Requirements** (examples):
   - Old: 5 workouts → New: 250 points
   - Old: 20 workouts → New: 1000 points

### ⚠️ Critical Implementation Details

1. **All calculations are server-side** - Never trust client
2. **Difficulty scores are in database** - Users can't modify
3. **Streaks use database functions** - Atomic operations
4. **Points require specific categories** - Attack/Defense/etc.

### 🐛 Known Issues / TODOs

1. **Verification**: Currently trust-based, needs video integration
2. **Performance**: Leaderboards will need caching at scale
3. **User Education**: Need onboarding for new system

### 💡 Quick Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Run tests
npm test -- anti-gaming.test.ts

# Check database
npm run db:migrate

# View demo
npm run dev
# Then visit: http://localhost:3000/test-gamification
```
