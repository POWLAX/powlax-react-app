## üìù Quick Fix Guide (Copy-Paste Solutions)

### Fix #1: Drill Data Query
```typescript
// In useSkillsAcademyWorkouts.ts, REPLACE the drill query with:
const { data: drills } = await supabase
  .from('skills_academy_workout_drills')
  .select(`
    *,
    drill:skills_academy_drill_library!inner(
      drill_name,
      both_hands_vimeo_id,
      strong_hand_vimeo_id,
      off_hand_vimeo_id
    )
  `)
  .eq('workout_id', workoutId)
  .order('sequence_order')
```

### Fix #2: Modal Styling
```tsx
// In WorkoutSizeSelector.tsx, wrap entire return in:
<div className="fixed inset-0 z-50 flex items-center justify-center p-4">
  <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-black/50" onClick={onBack} />
  <div className="relative bg-white rounded-lg shadow-xl max-w-4xl w-full">
    {/* ALL EXISTING CONTENT HERE with text-gray-900 for headers */}
  </div>
</div>
```

### Fix #3: Progress API
```typescript
// Create new file: src/app/api/workouts/progress/route.ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { userId, workoutId, drillId, completed } = await request.json()
  
  // Save to skills_academy_user_progress
  // Update user_points_balance_powlax
  // Return success response
}
```

## üß™ Test Commands

```bash
# After each fix, run:
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build

# Test specific workout:
curl http://localhost:3000/api/workouts/1

# Test progress save:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/workouts/progress \

## üö® If Something Goes Wrong

### Problem: Build fails after changes
**Solution:** Check for TypeScript errors, missing imports

### Problem: Drills still showing as "Drill 1, 2, 3"
**Solution:** Check Supabase RLS policies, verify drill_library has data

### Problem: Modal still dark after changes
**Solution:** Clear Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next && npm run dev`

### Problem: Points not saving
**Solution:** Check API route registration, verify database permissions
