## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Critical Patterns Followed
```typescript
// ‚úÖ MANDATORY - All components start with this
'use client'

// ‚úÖ NO lazy loading or dynamic imports
import Component from './Component' // Direct imports only

// ‚úÖ NO framer-motion animations
className="transition-colors" // CSS transitions only

// ‚úÖ Preserved auto-save functionality
// Lines 54-94 in practice-plans/page.tsx untouched

// ‚úÖ Notes synchronization pattern
interface Drill {
  notes?: string  // Shared between drill card and modal
  // ... other fields
}
```

### File Structure
```

## üêõ Bug Fixes - Sessions 8-9 (January 9, 2025)

### Lacrosse Lab Embed Interaction Issue
**Problem:** Lacrosse lab iframe embeds in Study modals were not clickable/interactive.

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. Z-index layering conflicts with loading overlay
2. Missing absolute positioning for iframe within tabs container
3. Insufficient iframe sandbox permissions
4. Tabs system overflow settings blocking interaction

**Complete Solution Implemented (Session 9):**
1. **Positioning Fix:**
   - Changed iframe from `className="w-full h-full"` to `className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full"`
   - Added explicit z-index: `style={{ pointerEvents: 'auto', zIndex: 1 }}`

2. **Loading Overlay Fix:**
   - Changed overlay from `z-10` to `z-20 pointer-events-none`
   - Ensured overlay doesn't block iframe interaction

3. **Permissions Fix:**
   - Added full sandbox attribute: `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-popups allow-presentation allow-pointer-lock"`
   - Maintained allow permissions: `allow="fullscreen; autoplay; accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"`

4. **Applied to Components:**
   - StudyDrillModal.tsx (fixed)
   - StudyStrategyModal.tsx (fixed)
   - LacrosseLabModal.tsx (already working, enhanced)

**Key Differences from Working LacrosseLabModal:**
- LacrosseLabModal has simpler structure without tabs
- Study modals needed absolute positioning to work within tabs container
- Loading overlays needed `pointer-events-none` to not block interaction

**Result:** All lacrosse lab diagrams are now fully interactive and clickable within the modals. Users can click play buttons and interact with embedded content.

## üöÄ Session 10 Updates (January 9, 2025)

### Mobile UX Enhancements & Notes Persistence
**Status:** ‚úÖ 100% Complete

#### **1. Mobile Fullscreen for Diagrams**

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/components/practice-planner/modals/StudyDrillModal.tsx`

#### **2. Bottom Menu Swipe Behavior Fix**
**What Was Implemented:**
- Fixed menu to slide up from bottom instead of just appearing

**What Was Implemented:**
- Button now moves up when menu is visible using dynamic classes
- Position changes from bottom-[25px] to bottom-[280px] when menu opens
- Smooth transition animation added for seamless UX
- Button no longer covered by navigation menu

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/app/(authenticated)/teams/[teamId]/practice-plans/page.tsx`

#### **4. Save Notes Functionality Fix**
**What Was Implemented:**
- Fixed save button in StudyDrillModal to properly call onUpdateDrill
- Notes now persist to localStorage with user-specific storage
- Notes are loaded from localStorage when drill is viewed
- Display shows saved notes instead of just drill.notes
- Notes persist across sessions and page refreshes

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/components/practice-planner/modals/StudyDrillModal.tsx`

#### **5. User-Specific Notes Persistence**
**What Was Implemented:**
- Implemented localStorage persistence using drill ID as key
- Notes survive page refreshes and are unique per drill
- Each user's notes are stored separately in their browser
- Users can mix and match drills with their custom notes intact
- Storage key format: `drill_notes_${drill.id}`

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// Save to localStorage
localStorage.setItem(`drill_notes_${drill.id}`, updatedNotes)

// Load from localStorage
const savedNotes = localStorage.getItem(`drill_notes_${drill.id}`)
```

## üìå Session 11 Updates (Sticky Accordion Headers - January 9, 2025)

### Sticky Category Headers Implementation
**Status:** ‚úÖ 100% Complete with positioning fix

#### **Initial Implementation:**
- When an accordion category is expanded in the drill or strategy library, its header becomes sticky
- As users scroll down within a category, the header sticks to the top of the container
- Users always know which category they're browsing, even when scrolling through long lists

#### **Positioning Fix (No Gap at Top):**
- **Problem:** Content was visible scrolling above sticky headers due to container padding
- **Solution:** Restructured padding to eliminate gap:
  1. Removed padding from scrollable container (`overflow-y-auto`)
  2. Added padding to inner content wrapper (`px-4 pt-4 pb-4`)
  3. Extended sticky headers to full width with negative margins

#### **Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// Container structure - no padding on overflow container
<div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto relative">
  <div className="px-4 pt-4 pb-4 space-y-2">
    
// Sticky header with full-width coverage
className={`w-full px-4 py-3 flex items-center justify-between bg-gray-50 hover:bg-gray-100 rounded-t-lg transition-all ${
  isExpanded ? 'sticky top-0 -mx-4 px-8 z-20 shadow-md border-b bg-white' : ''
}`}
```

#### **Key Changes:**
- **Container padding:** Moved from overflow container to inner wrapper
- **Sticky positioning:** `top-0` (flush with container top)
- **Full width:** `-mx-4 px-8` extends header to container edges
- **Z-index:** Increased to `z-20` for proper layering
- **Background:** Solid `bg-white` to hide scrolling content
- **Shadow:** Enhanced from `shadow-sm` to `shadow-md`

#### **Files Modified:**
- `/src/components/practice-planner/DrillLibraryTabbed.tsx` - Sticky headers with no-gap positioning
- `/src/components/practice-planner/StrategiesTab.tsx` - Matching sticky header implementation

### Session 11 Changes Summary:
85. ‚úÖ Implemented sticky accordion headers in DrillLibraryTabbed
86. ‚úÖ Implemented sticky accordion headers in StrategiesTab
87. ‚úÖ Headers remain visible at top of container when scrolling within expanded categories
88. ‚úÖ Added visual indicators (shadow, border) for sticky state
89. ‚úÖ Smooth transitions when headers become sticky
90. ‚úÖ Fixed gap issue - headers now flush with container top
91. ‚úÖ No content visible above sticky headers
92. ‚úÖ Full-width coverage preventing side gaps
