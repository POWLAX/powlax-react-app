## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Critical Patterns Followed
```typescript
// ‚úÖ MANDATORY - All components start with this
'use client'

// ‚úÖ NO lazy loading or dynamic imports
import Component from './Component' // Direct imports only

// ‚úÖ NO framer-motion animations
className="transition-colors" // CSS transitions only

// ‚úÖ Preserved auto-save functionality
// Lines 54-94 in practice-plans/page.tsx untouched

// ‚úÖ Notes synchronization pattern
interface Drill {
  notes?: string  // Shared between drill card and modal
  // ... other fields
}
```
