# Skills Academy Enhancement Plan v3.0
**Date:** 2025-08-10  
**Branch:** Claude-to-Claude-Sub-Agent-Work-Flow  
**Status:** READY FOR YOLO EXECUTION  
**Contract:** skills-academy-complete-003 (Enhanced)

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This plan builds upon the successful video fix implementation and introduces significant new features based on user feedback and coaching workflow requirements. The Skills Academy will be transformed into a comprehensive training platform with position-based tracks, intelligent workout selection, and robust gamification.

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### ✅ What's Working
- **Videos display correctly** with real Vimeo content (167 drills)
- **Page routing stable** - No 404 errors or vendor chunk issues
- **Basic workout flow** - Series → Size → Workout → Completion
- **Database populated** - 41 series, 118 workouts, 167 drills
- **Points system partial** - UI exists but needs persistence

### ❌ Critical Gaps
1. **No position-based navigation** - All workouts in one list
2. **Missing workout selection modal** - Direct navigation only
3. **Junction table empty** - `skills_academy_workout_drills` has 0 records
4. **No real progress tracking** - Points don't persist
5. **Missing gamification** - No streaks, badges, or leaderboards
6. **Poor mobile UX** - Small touch targets, no swipe gestures

## 🚀 Enhanced Features Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Position-Based Track System (4 hours)

#### 1.1 Track Cards on Main Page
Create three prominent position-specific training cards:

```typescript
interface TrackCard {
  id: 'attack' | 'midfield' | 'defense';
  title: string;
  description: string;
  icon: string;
  color: string;
  stats: {
    totalWorkouts: number;
    completedWorkouts: number;
    totalPoints: number;
    currentStreak: number;
  };
}
```

**Visual Design:**
- Large cards (min-height: 180px) with gradient backgrounds
- Position-specific icons (animated on hover/tap)
- Progress indicators showing completion percentage
- Current streak badge in corner
- Glowing border for active streaks

#### 1.2 Workout Selection Modal
Advanced modal with filtering and preview:

```typescript
interface WorkoutSelectionModal {
  track: 'attack' | 'midfield' | 'defense';
  filters: {
    difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
    duration: 'mini' | 'more' | 'complete';
    equipment: string[];
    focus: string[]; // shooting, passing, footwork, etc.
  };
  sortBy: 'recommended' | 'difficulty' | 'popularity' | 'newest';
  view: 'grid' | 'list';
}
```

**Features:**
- Smart recommendations based on user history
- Preview videos on hover (mobile: long press)
- Difficulty indicators with tooltips
- Time estimates for each workout
- Equipment requirements clearly shown
- "Coach Assigned" badge for prescribed workouts

#### 1.3 Smart Workout Recommendations
AI-driven workout suggestions:

```typescript
interface RecommendationEngine {
  factors: {
    lastCompleted: Date;
    skillGaps: string[];
    streakStatus: boolean;
    preferredDuration: string;
    performanceHistory: number[];
  };
  
  generateRecommendations(): Workout[] {
    // Algorithm considers:
    // - Skill progression path
    // - Recovery periods
    // - Variety to prevent burnout
    // - Current streak maintenance
    // - Coach assignments priority
  }
}
```

    voiceInstructions: boolean; // Optional audio cues
    progressBar: 'circular' | 'linear';
    animations: 'celebratory' | 'minimal';
  };
  
  controls: {
    didIt: () => void; // Mark complete & next
    skip: () => void; // Skip after 15s
    pause: () => void; // Pause workout
    getHint: () => void; // Show coaching tip
  };
}
```

**UI Enhancements:**

    reboundRewards: number; // Wall ball
    flexPoints: number; // Self-guided
  };
  
  multipliers: {
    streak: number; // 1.1x to 2x based on days
    complete: number; // 1.5x for full workout
    perfect: number; // 2x for no skips
    coach: number; // 1.3x for assigned workouts

SELECT 
  w.id as workout_id,
  d.id as drill_id,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY w.id ORDER BY d.difficulty, d.id) as order_position,
  CASE 
    WHEN w.workout_size = 'mini' THEN 30
    WHEN w.workout_size = 'more' THEN 45
    WHEN w.workout_size = 'complete' THEN 60
  END as duration_seconds
FROM skills_academy_workouts w
CROSS JOIN skills_academy_drills d
WHERE 
  -- Match workout type to drill category
  (w.series_type = 'attack' AND d.category LIKE '%attack%') OR
  (w.series_type = 'defense' AND d.category LIKE '%defense%') OR
  (w.series_type = 'midfield' AND d.category IN ('passing', 'ground_balls', 'transitions')) OR
  (w.series_type = 'solid_start' AND d.difficulty = 1)
  -- Limit drills per workout based on size
  AND d.id IN (
    SELECT id FROM skills_academy_drills d2
    WHERE d2.category = d.category
    ORDER BY RANDOM()
    LIMIT CASE 
      WHEN w.workout_size = 'mini' THEN 5
      WHEN w.workout_size = 'more' THEN 8
      WHEN w.workout_size = 'complete' THEN 12
    END
  );
```
