## 📊 System Architecture

### Database Structure
```
skills_academy_series (41 records)
├── id, series_type, series_name, series_description
├── workout_count, display_order, is_active
└── Types: solid_start, attack, midfield, defense

skills_academy_workouts (118 records)
├── id, series_id, workout_size (mini/more/complete)
├── drill_ids[] (array of integers - direct connection!)
├── drill_count, workout_name, duration_minutes
└── Example: {id: 3, drill_ids: [11,12,13,14,15]}

skills_academy_drills (167 records)
├── id, title, video_url, vimeo_id
├── drill_category, equipment_needed, age_progressions
├── space_needed, complexity, sets_and_reps
└── duration_minutes, point_values, tags

❌ skills_academy_workout_drills (0 records - UNUSED)
```

### Key Discovery: drill_ids Column
- **No junction table needed** - workouts connect directly to drills via `drill_ids` array
- **Maintains order** - array sequence determines drill display order
- **Fully populated** - all 118 workouts have complete drill connections

## 🚀 Implemented Features

### 1. Position-Based Training Tracks
Located at `/skills-academy/workouts`

#### Track Configuration
```typescript
const tracks = [
  {
    id: 'solid_start',

    description: 'Develop essential skills fast!',
    color: 'bg-gray-500',
    seriesType: 'solid_start'
  },
  {
    id: 'attack',
    title: 'Attack Training',
    description: 'Master every attack skill in 12 workouts!',
    color: 'bg-green-500',
    seriesType: 'attack'
  },
  {
    id: 'midfield',
    title: 'Midfield Training',

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Access Pattern
```typescript
// Get workouts by position
const { data: series } = await supabase
  .from('skills_academy_series')
  .select('*')
  .eq('series_type', trackType)
  .eq('is_active', true)
  .order('display_order');

// Get workout with drills
const { data: workout } = await supabase
  .from('skills_academy_workouts')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', workoutId)
  .single();

// Get drills in correct order
const { data: drills } = await supabase
  .from('skills_academy_drills')
  .select('*')
  .in('id', workout.drill_ids);

// Sort drills to match drill_ids order
const sortedDrills = workout.drill_ids
  .map(id => drills.find(d => d.id === id))
  .filter(Boolean);
```

### Row Level Security Solution
**Problem:** RLS was blocking anonymous users from accessing data  
**Solution:** Disabled RLS on Skills Academy tables
```sql
ALTER TABLE skills_academy_drills DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE skills_academy_workouts DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE skills_academy_series DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Video ID Extraction
```typescript
function extractVimeoId(drill: any): string | null {
  // Check direct vimeo_id field first
  if (drill.vimeo_id) return drill.vimeo_id;
  
  // Extract from video_url if needed
  const videoUrl = drill.video_url;
  if (!videoUrl) return null;
  
  const patterns = [
    /vimeo\.com\/(\d+)/,
    /player\.vimeo\.com\/video\/(\d+)/,
    /^(\d+)$/
  ];
  
  for (const pattern of patterns) {
    const match = videoUrl.match(pattern);
    if (match) return match[1];
  }
  
  return null;
}
```

## 🛠️ Resolved Issues

### ✅ Fixed: Video Playback
- **Root Cause:** Row Level Security blocking anonymous users
- **Solution:** Disabled RLS on Skills Academy tables
- **Result:** Videos now play with real Vimeo content

### ✅ Fixed: Vendor Chunk Errors
- **Root Cause:** Framer-motion partial removal
- **Solution:** Complete removal from 12 contaminated files
- **Result:** Clean webpack builds, no 404 errors

### ✅ Fixed: Drill Order
- **Root Cause:** Not using drill_ids array sequence
- **Solution:** Sort drills to match drill_ids order
- **Result:** Drills display in correct workout sequence

### ✅ Fixed: Navigation Controls
- **Root Cause:** Complex Previous/Next logic
- **Solution:** Dropdown menu for direct drill selection
- **Result:** Intuitive navigation with visual status

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Do NOT Re-enable RLS
Row Level Security is intentionally disabled on Skills Academy tables. Re-enabling will break video access for anonymous users.

### Drill Connection Method
- Use `drill_ids` array from workouts table
- Do NOT use `skills_academy_workout_drills` junction table (it's empty)
- Always maintain drill order from the array

### Mobile Navigation
- Swipeable bottom nav only appears on mobile (<768px)
- Desktop uses sidebar navigation
- Test swipe gestures on actual devices

### Video Fallbacks
- Always check for vimeo_id or video_url
- Provide placeholder UI when video missing
- Log missing videos for content team
