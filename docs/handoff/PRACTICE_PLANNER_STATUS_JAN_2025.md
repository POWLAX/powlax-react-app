# Practice Planner Status & Handoff Document

**Date:** January 9, 2025  
**Branch:** Claude-to-Claude-Sub-Agent-Work-Flow  
**Status:** Partially Implemented - Core Functionality Working

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

The Practice Planner is POWLAX's core feature for lacrosse coaches to create structured practice plans. The system is functional with significant UI enhancements in progress. Recent work focused on implementing the new UI design specifications, fixing alignment issues, and creating unified Study modals.

---

## ✅ Completed Work (January 9, 2025)

### 1. **Strategies Library Alignment Fix**
- **Issue:** Strategies Library header appeared halfway down the tab content
- **Root Cause:** Extra wrapper div with `h-full flex flex-col` in StrategiesTab component
- **Solution:** 
  - Added `flex flex-col` to strategies TabsContent to match drills structure
  - Removed problematic wrapper, using React Fragment instead
  - Both headers now align perfectly at the same vertical position
- **Files Modified:**
  - `src/components/practice-planner/DrillLibraryTabbed.tsx`
  - `src/components/practice-planner/StrategiesTab.tsx`

### 2. **New UI Components Created**
- **ActiveStrategiesSection.tsx** - Displays selected strategies above practice timeline
  - Two-column layout: "With Ball" and "Defending Ball"
  - Color-coded strategy cards by game phase
  - Accordion-style expandable interface
- **PracticeScheduleCard.tsx** - Blue-tinted practice schedule header
  - Inline editable date/time fields
  - Duration and end time display
  - Setup time checkbox option
- **StudyDrillModal.tsx** - Unified modal for studying drills
  - Three tabs: Overview, Diagram, Video
  - Consistent 90% viewport width
  - White background design
- **StudyStrategyModal.tsx** - Unified modal for studying strategies
  - Matches StudyDrillModal structure
  - Integrates strategy details, videos, and diagrams

### 3. **UI Enhancements Implemented**
- Study buttons added to drill and strategy cards (black button with play icon)
- Blue-tinted design system for practice schedule (bg-blue-50, border-blue-200)
- Improved visual hierarchy with larger time displays (text-2xl)
- Coaching notes with blue background boxes
- Trash icons positioned in top-right corners

## 🚧 In Progress / Partially Complete

### 1. **Practice Timeline Redesign**
- **Status:** Core structure exists, visual updates needed
- **Remaining Work:**
  - Update DrillCard component to match new design specs
  - Implement gray background for parallel drill containers
  - Add purple "PARALLEL" badge
  - Update time display to large blue text (2xl font)
  - Position Study Drill buttons correctly

### 2. **Modal Integration**
- **Status:** Modals created but need full integration
- **Remaining Work:**
  - Wire up Study buttons to open new modals
  - Implement diagram/image tabs with proper content
  - Add coaches notes section to Overview tab
  - Ensure all modals have consistent white backgrounds

### 3. **Mobile Responsiveness**
- **Status:** Basic mobile layout exists, needs refinement
- **Remaining Work:**
  - Test and fix mobile drill selection
  - Ensure proper touch targets (44px minimum)
  - Optimize bottom navigation button placement

---

## 🔴 Known Issues & Bugs

1. **TypeScript Errors** - Multiple TS errors in scripts/ directory (not blocking functionality)
2. **ESLint Warnings** - AnimatePresence undefined in gamification pages
3. **Print Functionality** - Needs testing with new UI components
4. **Auto-save** - Working but needs testing with new components
5. **Setup Time Modal** - Not fully integrated with new design

## 🎯 Next Steps & Priorities

### High Priority (Complete First):
1. **Finish Timeline Visual Updates**
   - Update DrillCard to match design specs
   - Implement proper Study Drill button placement
   - Add blue coaching notes boxes
   - Fix parallel drill visual hierarchy

2. **Complete Modal Integration**
   - Connect all Study buttons to new modals
   - Implement diagram content loading
   - Add image gallery functionality
   - Ensure coaches notes display properly

3. **Testing & Bug Fixes**
   - Test all functionality with new components
   - Fix any console errors
   - Verify mobile responsiveness
   - Test print functionality

### Medium Priority:
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize component re-renders
   - Improve auto-save efficiency
   - Reduce bundle size

2. **Documentation**
   - Update component documentation
   - Create user guide for new features
   - Document API endpoints

### Low Priority:
1. **Enhanced Features**
   - Add drag-and-drop for timeline
   - Implement advanced filtering
   - Add practice templates

---

## 🔧 Technical Debt & Cleanup

1. **Code Organization**
   - Some components have mixed responsibilities
   - Need to extract shared types/interfaces
   - Consolidate modal logic

2. **State Management**
   - Consider implementing context for practice state
   - Reduce prop drilling in nested components
   - Optimize re-renders

3. **Testing**
   - No unit tests for new components
   - Need E2E tests for practice creation flow
   - Add visual regression tests

---

## 📝 Important Notes for Next Developer

### Critical Rules (DO NOT BREAK):
1. **NO LAZY LOADING** - Will break Practice Planner completely
2. **NO FRAMER-MOTION** - Causes SSR errors
3. **ALL COMPONENTS MUST USE 'use client'** - No server components
4. **MAINTAIN WHITE MODAL BACKGROUNDS** - Not dark blue
5. **PRESERVE AUTO-SAVE** - Every 3 seconds to localStorage

### Design System:
- Primary Blue: #003366
- Light Blue Background: rgb(239 246 255) / bg-blue-50
- Blue Border: rgb(191 219 254) / border-blue-200
- Gray Background: rgb(243 244 246) / bg-gray-100
- Time Display: text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600

### Testing Commands:
```bash
npm run dev              # Start dev server (port 3000)
npm run lint             # Check for linting errors
npm run typecheck        # Check TypeScript errors
npm run build            # Production build test
```

### Common Issues & Solutions:
- **If strategies header misaligns:** Check StrategiesTab wrapper structure
- **If drills won't load:** Check useDrills hook and Supabase connection
- **If modals won't open:** Verify button onClick handlers and modal state
- **If mobile layout breaks:** Check responsive classes and touch targets
