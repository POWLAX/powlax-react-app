## 🎬 Video System Architecture

### Database Structure (Working)
```sql
-- skills_academy_workouts
id: 1, workout_name: "SS1 - Mini Workout", drill_ids: [1,2,3,4,5]

-- skills_academy_drills  
id: 1, title: "2 Hand Cradle Away Drill", vimeo_id: "1000143414"
id: 2, title: "2 Hockey Pick Up Ground Ball Drill", vimeo_id: "995813226"
```

### Video Rendering Flow (Working)
1. **useWorkoutSession** fetches workout with drill_ids array
2. **Database query** gets drills using `in(id, workout.drill_ids)`  
3. **extractVimeoId** extracts video ID from drill data
4. **Responsive iframe** renders: `https://player.vimeo.com/video/{vimeoId}`

### Component Architecture (Stable)
- **Workout page** (`/skills-academy/workout/[id]`) - ✅ Renders videos
- **extractVimeoId helper** - ✅ Handles multiple video field types  
- **useWorkoutSession hook** - ✅ Connects workouts to drills
- **Video player component** - ✅ Responsive 16:9 aspect ratio

## 🎉 CONCLUSION

**The Skills Academy video display issue is COMPLETELY RESOLVED.**

Users can now:
- Navigate to any workout page without 404 errors
- View drill videos in responsive Vimeo players  
- Use navigation controls to progress through workouts
- Experience consistent loading times and performance

The sophisticated infrastructure was already in place - the Ultra Think analysis identified that framer-motion vendor chunk errors were preventing component hydration. Once those were resolved, the existing video system worked perfectly.

**Mission Status: SUCCESS** 🎯
