# Product Requirements Document: Voice-to-Stat Interface for Lacrosse Game Tracking

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Overview
The Voice-to-Stat Interface is an intelligent, voice-activated lacrosse statistics tracking system that uses contextual game state awareness to streamline real-time stat collection during live games. The system automatically transitions between game states and provides relevant voice prompts to capture comprehensive game statistics with minimal user friction.
