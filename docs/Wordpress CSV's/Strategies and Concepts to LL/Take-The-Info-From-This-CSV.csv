The rules for this offense are as follows. 

The players are divided into midfield and attack groups of 3 players.
Motions are movements made when your group has the ball -  rotations are movements made with the other group has the ball.

We are using push pull -  motions -  exclusively. So if a player in your group is dodging -  and you are behind them -  they will pull you and  you must follow. If you are in front of them they will push you into the middle. The crease player will always float out the back side.

Dodgers can go any direction -  but if they dodge out of their box -  they need to get back to the crease once they move the ball. 

The only rotation we are using is backside exchange linear exchange. So -  wherever the Dodge happens from -  the player on the opposite side of the field -  and the crease player will switch places.","<iframe width=""500"" height=""500"" src=""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=7ztvLNlzQaAM5ECRK9Eg"" style=""max-width: 100%""></iframe>"
