## Important Note on Drill Mapping

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: The Wall Ball workouts appear to have a different structure than Solid Start workouts:
- **Solid Start workouts**: Multiple individual drills (5-10 drills per workout)
- **Wall Ball workouts**: Often just ONE question/item that contains the entire video workout

### Example Structure Comparison:

#### Solid Start 5 - Switching Hands Workout - More (ID: 312)
- Has 10 individual drills:
  1. Shoulder to Nose Cradle
  2. Quick Switches Hand Speed Drill
  3. Standing Switches - Up to Pass Drill
  4. Step Away Passing Drill
  5. Strong Hand Wide Turn Ground Ball to Long Pass Drill
  6. Stick Away Turn and Switch Hands Drill
  7. Roll Dodge to Set Feet - Time and Room Shooting Drill
  8. Off Hand Wide Turn Ground Balls
  9. Single Jab Split Dodge Drill
  10. Split to Set Feet - Time and Room Shooting Drill

#### Master Fundamentals Wall Ball Workout - 10 Minutes (ID: 127)
- Has 1 question/item:
  1. "10 Minute – Master Fundamentals Wall Ball Workout" (single video)

## Mapping Strategy

For Wall Ball workouts, you may need a different approach:
1. The workout itself IS the drill (one video per workout)
2. The `_title` field might contain the full workout name rather than individual drill names - EXACTLY
3. These might need to be imported as single-drill workouts - NO, THESE ALL MAP TO ANOTHER DOCUMENT THAT PUTS THE INDIVIDAL WALL BALL DRILLS INTO EACH INDIVIDUAL VIDEO.

## Recommendation

Consider creating two import strategies:
1. **Multi-drill workouts** (like Solid Start): Map each question._title to skills_academy_drills.title
2. **Single-video workouts** (like Wall Ball): The entire workout is one video/drill
