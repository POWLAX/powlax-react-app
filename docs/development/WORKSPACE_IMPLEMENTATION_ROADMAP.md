# POWLAX Workspace Implementation Roadmap
**Generated by**: Workspace Organization Architect (A4CC)  
**Date**: January 15, 2025  
**Status**: Ready for Execution

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This roadmap provides a 3-phase approach to transform the POWLAX workspace from its current chaotic state into an organized, efficient development environment. The implementation prioritizes stability first, then organization, then optimization.

**Timeline**: 3 weeks total  
**Impact**: Improved developer productivity, reduced onboarding time, enhanced agent coordination  
**Risk Level**: Low (backup-first approach)

---

## 📊 Current State Assessment

### ❌ Critical Issues
- 40+ core files deleted but not committed
- 50+ untracked files cluttering root directory
- Duplicate configuration files causing conflicts
- No structured task management system
- Missing inter-agent coordination protocols

### ✅ Strengths to Preserve
- Functional src/ directory with TypeScript migration
- Comprehensive documentation in docs/
- Active development artifacts and scripts
- Working CI/CD with Playwright tests

---

## 🚀 Phase 1: Emergency Stabilization (Days 1-5)

### **Day 1: Backup & Assessment**
**Goal**: Create safety net and validate current functionality

**Morning Tasks**:
```bash
# Create backup branch
git checkout -b workspace-cleanup-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
git push -u origin workspace-cleanup-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Document current state
git status > current-git-status.txt
npm run build > build-status.txt 2>&1
npm test > test-status.txt 2>&1
```

**Afternoon Tasks**:
- Verify all functionality exists in src/ directory
- Test critical workflows (build, test, deploy)
- Document any broken functionality for immediate fix

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Backup branch created and pushed
- [x] Current functionality documented
- [x] Critical issues identified

### **Day 2: Git Repository Cleanup**
**Goal**: Resolve all deleted files and commit decisions

**ESLint Configuration Recovery**:
```bash
# Check if ESLint config is needed
npx eslint --init
# Or restore if previous config was better
git show HEAD:eslint.config.mjs > eslint.config.js
```

**File Restoration/Deletion**:
```bash
# Restore critical files
git checkout HEAD -- eslint.config.mjs

# Archive important docs before deletion
mkdir -p docs/archive
git show HEAD:POWLAX-Development-Framework.md > docs/archive/POWLAX-Development-Framework.md
git show HEAD:POWLAX-React-Implementation-Plan.md > docs/archive/POWLAX-React-Implementation-Plan.md

# Stage deletions for migrated files
git add -u app/
git add -u components/ui/
git add -u *.mjs

# Commit with detailed message
git commit -m "chore: Complete app/ to src/ migration and config cleanup

Files migrated to TypeScript in src/:
- app/ directory → src/app/ 
- components/ → src/components/
- Configuration files consolidated

Preserved:
- Project documentation in docs/archive/
- ESLint configuration for code quality

All functionality verified in new structure."
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] No uncommitted deletions in git status
- [x] ESLint configuration functional
- [x] Build and tests still pass

### **Day 3: Root Directory Organization**
**Goal**: Clean root directory and organize data files

**Create Organization Structure**:
```bash
mkdir -p data/{imports,summaries,mappings}
mkdir -p docs/media/screenshots
mkdir -p docs/development/logs
mkdir -p docs/guides
```

**Move Files to Proper Locations**:
```bash
# SQL imports
mv *.sql data/imports/

# JSON summaries  
mv *_summary.json data/summaries/

# CSV mappings
mv lacrosse_lab_*.csv data/mappings/

# Screenshots
mv screenshots/* docs/media/screenshots/
rmdir screenshots

# Documentation
mv AGENT-MODIFICATIONS-LOG.md docs/development/logs/
mv POWLAX_Data_Sources_Analysis.md docs/technical/
mv SKILLS_ACADEMY_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md docs/guides/
mv VIMEO_API_SETUP.md docs/guides/
```

**Update .gitignore**:
```bash
echo "# Development artifacts" >> .gitignore
echo "playwright-report/" >> .gitignore
echo "test-results/" >> .gitignore
echo ".bmad-core/" >> .gitignore
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Root directory has < 15 files
- [x] All data files organized by type
- [x] Development artifacts ignored

### **Day 4: Configuration Consolidation**
**Goal**: Resolve duplicate configurations and document decisions

**Configuration Audit**:
```bash
# Compare configurations
diff next.config.js next.config.mjs || echo "Files differ"
diff postcss.config.js postcss.config.mjs || echo "Files differ"
```

**Decision Matrix Implementation**:
- Keep: `.js` files for broader compatibility
- Remove: `.mjs` duplicates after verification
- Document: All decisions in commit message

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] No duplicate configuration files
- [x] All configs functional
- [x] Decisions documented

### **Day 5: Functionality Verification**
**Goal**: Ensure all changes maintain system functionality

**Full System Test**:
```bash
npm run build
npm run test
npm run lint
npx playwright test
```

**Documentation Update**:
- Update README.md with new structure
- Document any breaking changes
- Create migration guide for other developers

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] All builds pass
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] Documentation current

## 🏗️ Phase 2: Task System Implementation (Days 6-12)

### **Day 6-7: Task Structure Creation**
**Goal**: Implement new task management system

**Directory Creation**:
```bash
cd tasks/
mkdir -p active/{database,gamification,frontend,infrastructure,academy}
mkdir -p completed
mkdir -p templates
mkdir -p coordination/daily-progress
mkdir -p backlog
```

**Template Implementation**:
- Copy templates from `/templates/` to proper locations
- Customize for POWLAX-specific needs
- Create first coordination log entry

### **Day 8-9: Content Migration**
**Goal**: Move existing tasks to new structure

**Current Task Audit**:
```bash
find tasks/ -name "*.md" -not -path "*/templates/*"
```

**Migration Process**:
- Move gamification tasks to `tasks/active/gamification/`
- Move database tasks to `tasks/active/database/`  
- Update all file references to use relative paths
- Create initial coordination entries

### **Day 10-11: Agent Integration**
**Goal**: Update all agent specifications for new structure

**Agent Documents to Update**:
- `docs/agent-instructions/C4A - Database Integration Architect - 2025-01-15.md`
- `docs/agent-instructions/C4A - Gamification Implementation Architect - 2025-01-15.md`
- All other A4CC agent specifications

**Required Updates**:
1. Add task workspace locations
2. Add coordination requirements
3. Add relative path standards
4. Add progress reporting requirements

### **Day 12: Process Documentation**
**Goal**: Create operational procedures

**Documentation Creation**:
- Task lifecycle procedures
- Agent coordination protocols
- Daily/weekly reporting standards
- Escalation procedures

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] All tasks in new structure
- [x] All agents updated for new system
- [x] Coordination protocols active

## 🔧 Phase 3: Process Optimization (Days 13-21)

### **Day 13-14: Automation Setup**
**Goal**: Reduce manual overhead with automation

**Scripts to Create**:
```bash
# Daily progress reminder
scripts/task-management/daily-reminder.sh

# Task archival automation  
scripts/task-management/archive-completed.sh

# Coordination report generator
scripts/task-management/generate-status.sh
```

### **Day 15-16: Path Reference Standardization**
**Goal**: Ensure all documentation uses relative paths

**Audit Process**:
```bash
# Find files with absolute paths
grep -r "/Users/" docs/
grep -r "C:\\" docs/

# Find files with incomplete references
grep -r "\.tsx" docs/ | grep -v "src/"
```

**Update Process**:
- Replace all absolute paths with relative paths
- Add path validation to CI pipeline
- Create path reference guide

### **Day 17-18: Agent Coordination Enhancement**
**Goal**: Optimize inter-agent communication

**Coordination Features**:
- Automated daily progress aggregation
- Blocking issue escalation

- Agent workload balancing

### **Day 19-20: Testing & Validation**
**Goal**: Ensure new system works reliably

**Test Scenarios**:
- Complete task lifecycle (create → execute → complete → archive)
- Multi-agent coordination on shared task
- Blocking issue resolution workflow
- New agent onboarding process

### **Day 21: Go-Live & Documentation**
**Goal**: Final rollout and knowledge transfer

**Final Steps**:
