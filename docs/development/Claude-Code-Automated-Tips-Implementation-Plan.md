# Claude Code Automated Tips Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the technical implementation for automatically delivering contextual Claude Code workflow tips based on user actions and workflow stages.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Command-Based Tip System (Immediate - 1-2 hours)

Create custom Claude Code commands that users can invoke to get contextual tips.

#### Commands to Create

1. **`/workflow-start`** - Beginning a new task
2. **`/workflow-plan`** - Planning phase guidance  
3. **`/workflow-review`** - Review and handoff guidance
4. **`/context-rescue`** - When context window fills up
5. **`/quality-check`** - Code quality enforcement

#### Implementation Steps

```bash
# Create commands directory in project root
mkdir -p .claude/commands

# Create individual command files
```

### Phase 2: Smart Detection System (Short-term - 1 week)

Implement pattern matching to automatically suggest relevant commands.

#### Detection Patterns

```javascript
// Workflow stage detection patterns
const triggerPatterns = {
  workflowStart: [
    /begin working/i,
    /start.*task/i, 
    /working on/i,
    /let's (start|begin)/i
  ],
  planningNeeded: [
    /plan/i,
    /architecture/i, 
    /design/i,
    /how should (we|I)/i
  ],
  contextLimit: [
    /context.*full/i,
    /running out.*space/i,
    /token.*limit/i
  ],
  qualityCheck: [
    /review/i,
    /check.*code/i,
    /does this look/i
  ],
  handoffNeeded: [
    /(done|finished|complete)/i,
    /ready.*(for|to)/i,
    /next.*developer/i
  ]
};
```

### Phase 3: Automated Integration (Medium-term - 2-3 weeks)

Full automation through terminal integration and file watchers.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Command Templates

#### 1. `/workflow-start` Command

```markdown
# Workflow Start Guide

## Before You Begin: The Sacred Trinity

Remember: **Explore → Plan → Execute** (Never skip to Execute!)

### Step 1: Context Building
Use the "Prepare" method:

**Instead of**: "Build a login form"
**Try**: "Prepare to discuss how our authentication system works. Read relevant files and understand the current implementation."

Let Claude spend 50k+ tokens building context (7+ minutes). If the overview is wrong, escape and restart.

### Step 2: Context Preservation  
After building context:
- Double escape (`⎋⎋`) to fork the conversation
- Use `resume` to pull context into new terminals
- Keep multiple smart Claude instances running

### Next Steps
- Run `/workflow-plan` when ready to create task breakdown
- Remember: Context is everything!
```

#### 2. `/workflow-plan` Command

```markdown
# Planning Phase Guide

## Risk Assessment
First, categorize your task:
- **Low Risk**: Skip elaborate planning, just execute
- **Medium/Large**: Break into PR-sized chunks  
- **High Risk**: Take 2-3 planning shots

## Planning Prompts That Work

### For Task Breakdown:
"Create a plan for [task]. Write function names in 1-3 sentences about what they do. Write test names in 5-10 words about behavior they cover. Think architecturally, not in code details."

### Critical Anti-Patterns to Avoid:
- NO backwards compatibility unless absolutely necessary
- NO graceful fallbacks (they create silent failures)
- Focus on editing existing code vs. rewriting

## Multi-Claude Planning Method
1. Have current Claude create plan
2. Double escape, use new tab: "My developer created this plan for [task]. What do you think as my technical advisor?"
3. Get specific critique, not generic praise
4. Break final plan into PR-sized chunks

### Next Steps
- Run `/quality-check` before implementation
- Use `/context-rescue` if approaching token limits
```

#### 3. `/workflow-review` Command

```markdown
# Code Review & Handoff Guide

## The Two-Tab Review System

### Developer Tab (Current)
This tab does the actual implementation work.

### Planner Tab (New - Double Escape First)
**Critical Prompt Pattern**:

❌ "Review this code" → Claude will praise its own work
✅ "My developer just implemented [feature]. Give them specific technical feedback as if you're on my team, not theirs."

## Handoff Preparation

### Before Finishing:
"Document what you've accomplished for the next developer. Include:
- Current state and what was completed
- Any challenges encountered  
- Specific files that need attention
- Next logical steps
- Important context to preserve"

### Quality Verification:
- Run linting/compilation checks
- Have Claude write scripts to verify functionality
- Test against known good/bad examples

### Next Steps
- Use `/context-rescue` for context management
- Run `/workflow-start` for next task phase
```

#### 4. `/context-rescue` Command

```markdown
# Context Window Management

## Current Situation: Context Getting Full

### DON'T Use Compact
Compact is wasteful and creates confused Claude instances.

### DO Use These Techniques:

#### Option 1: Rewind (Recommended)
- Scroll back to 40% context usage
- Document current progress in markdown
- Continue from that point with "Here's what I accomplished: [summary]"

#### Option 2: Double Escape Fork
- Double escape (`⎋⎋`) to preserve current smart Claude
- Start new tab with same context
- Use `resume` to pull in knowledge

#### Option 3: Strategic Reset
- If current Claude lost context quality
- Start fresh but with comprehensive prep phase
- Use `/workflow-start` to rebuild properly

## Context Economics
- You only pay for NEW tokens
- Reusing smart Claude instances is cost-effective
- Keep 5+ terminals with expert context running

### Emergency Context Recovery:
"Prepare to continue working on [current task]. Read all relevant files and understand exactly where we left off."
```

#### 5. `/quality-check` Command  

```markdown
# Code Quality Enforcement

## Quality Checklist

### Before Writing Code:
- [ ] Built sufficient context (50k+ tokens)  
- [ ] Understand existing architecture
- [ ] Have clear, specific requirements

### While Writing Code:
- [ ] Edit existing code vs. rewriting
- [ ] No backwards compatibility bloat
- [ ] Fail fast, no silent fallbacks
- [ ] Write tests first (TDD approach)

### After Writing Code:
- [ ] Run linting/compilation
- [ ] Have Claude write verification scripts
- [ ] Test against edge cases
- [ ] Document changes in CHANGELOG

## Quality Enforcement Prompts

### For Better Code:
"Write elegant code that completes this task. Edit existing code rather than rewriting. No graceful fallbacks - fail fast and visibly."

### For Testing:
"Use TDD: Write the failing test first, then write code that makes it pass."

### For Integration:
"Make the minimal changes necessary to integrate this properly with the existing codebase."

## Anti-Pattern Alerts
- ❌ "Enterprise-ready" solutions (over-engineering)
- ❌ Copying code to multiple locations
- ❌ Backwards compatibility "just in case"
- ❌ Graceful degradation (silent failures)

# .claude/commands/context-rescue.md
# .claude/commands/quality-check.md
```

### Step 2: Add Monitoring Script

```bash
# Add the claude-tips-monitor.js file to project root
# Make it executable
chmod +x claude-tips-monitor.js

# Test it
./claude-tips-monitor.js "I'm going to begin working on a new feature"
```

### Step 3: Optional Shell Integration

```bash
# Add claude-tips-prompt.sh to your shell configuration
echo 'source /path/to/claude-tips-prompt.sh' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Usage Examples

### Starting a New Task
```bash
# User types:
claude "I'm going to start working on the user authentication system"

# System suggests:
# 💡 Consider using the Explore→Plan→Execute approach. Try `/workflow-start` for guidance.

# User can then run:
claude /workflow-start
```

### During Planning
```bash
# User types:
claude "How should I approach building this complex dashboard?"

# System suggests:
# 🎯 Planning phase detected. Use `/workflow-plan` for structured approach.

claude /workflow-plan
```

### Context Management
```bash
# User types: 
claude "I'm running out of context space and Claude seems confused"

# System suggests:
# 🚨 Context window issues? Use `/context-rescue` for management strategies.

claude /context-rescue
```
