# POWLAX Integrated Workflow Plan

*Created: 2025-01-16*  
*Purpose: Unified workflow combining BMad, A4CC, and Claude Code sub agents*

---

## 🎯 **WORKFLOW OVERVIEW**

This plan integrates three agent frameworks into a cohesive development workflow that leverages the strengths of each while ensuring proper context management and coordination.

**Integrated Framework Benefits:**
- **BMad Agents**: Strategic planning and architecture decisions
- **A4CC Agents**: Error-free implementation with proven patterns
- **Claude Code Sub Agents**: Complex task coordination and execution

**Core Philosophy:** The right agent for the right task at the right time, with complete context sharing.

## 📋 **UNIFIED WORKFLOW PHASES**

### **Phase 1: Strategic Planning (BMad Framework)**

**When to Use:** New features, architecture decisions, complex problem-solving

**Agent Selection:**
```markdown
Primary: BMad Orchestrator + relevant specialists

- UX Expert: User experience and interface design
- Developer: Technical feasibility assessment
```

**Deliverables:**
- Feature requirements document
- Technical architecture specification
- Implementation roadmap
- Risk assessment and mitigation plan
- Context package for implementation agents

**Context Handoff Package:**
```markdown
BMad → Implementation Agents Handoff:

1. Strategic Context:
   - Feature purpose and business value
   - User personas and use cases
   - Success criteria and metrics

2. Technical Context:
   - Architecture decisions made
   - Component relationships
   - Database schema changes needed
   - API integrations required

3. Implementation Guidance:
   - Recommended approach
   - Known complexity areas
   - Testing requirements
   - Mobile considerations

4. Quality Gates:
   - Acceptance criteria
