# Agent Testing Plan - Post-Refactoring

## üéØ Testing Objectives
Validate that the refactored agent system reduces overwhelm while maintaining functionality.

## üìã Test Scenarios

### Phase 1: BMad Orchestrator Testing
**Goal**: Verify orchestrator can efficiently coordinate with minimal context loading

**Test Cases**:
1. **Cold Start Test**
   - New terminal session
   - Load BMad orchestrator: `/BMad:agents:bmad-orchestrator`
   - Verify it loads only essential context (~500 tokens)
   - Check that it references new file locations correctly

2. **Context Loading Test**
   - Request project overview
   - Verify it loads `.bmad-core/context/POWLAX-AGENT-QUICK-CONTEXT.md` 
   - Confirm it doesn't auto-load heavy documentation

3. **Agent Handoff Test**
   - Request component work
   - Verify it recommends correct specialized agent
   - Check handoff includes minimal necessary context

### Phase 2: Specialized Agent Testing  
**Goal**: Validate enhanced agents work with new documentation structure

**Test Cases**:
1. **Developer Agent (James)**
   - Load agent: `/BMad:agents:dev`
   - Request React component work
   - Verify it finds moved C4A framework at new location
   - Check component architecture understanding

2. **Architect Agent (Winston)**
   - Load agent: `/BMad:agents:architect`
   - Request system design task
   - Verify lacrosse domain expertise is retained
   - Check integration with reorganized documentation

3. **UX Expert Agent (Sally)**
   - Load agent: `/BMad:agents:ux-expert`
   - Request UI/UX task
   - Verify youth sports specialization
   - Check mobile-first approach

### Phase 3: Documentation Access Testing
**Goal**: Ensure agents can find and load documentation on-demand

**Test Cases**:
1. **Load-on-Demand Test**
   - Agent starts with minimal context
   - User requests detailed work requiring full context
   - Agent loads appropriate documentation from new locations
   - Verify token usage stays reasonable

2. **File Location Test**
   - Agent needs technical architecture
   - Should find `docs/agent-instructions/C4A - Cursor For Agents.md`
   - Should not get confused by old file paths

3. **Progress Tracking Test**
   - Agent checks current project status
   - Should find `TRACK_A_PROGRESS.md` in root (unchanged)
   - Should find `docs/track-b-project-summary.md` in docs

### Phase 4: Communication Protocol Testing
**Goal**: Verify enhanced communication standards work

**Test Cases**:
1. **Status Reporting Test**
   - Agent completes task
   - Should use standardized status format
   - Should sign with "- [Agent Name]"
   - Should update progress files correctly

2. **Cross-Agent Awareness Test**
   - One agent finishes task, hands off to another
   - Second agent should understand context
   - Should reference previous agent's work appropriately

## üìä Success Metrics

### Token Usage Efficiency
- **Cold Start**: ‚â§500 tokens for initialization
- **Quick Context**: ‚â§300 tokens for basic project understanding  
- **Load-on-Demand**: Only load heavy docs when actually needed
- **Session Total**: Reasonable token usage throughout conversation

### Communication Quality
- **Status Updates**: Clear, consistent format per `AGENT-MODIFICATIONS-LOG.md`
- **File References**: Correct file paths with new organization
- **Agent Signatures**: Consistent "- [Agent Name]" format
- **Cross-References**: Agents reference each other's work appropriately

### Task Completion
- **Context Awareness**: Agents understand POWLAX domain without heavy loading
- **Specialization**: Each agent demonstrates their enhanced expertise
- **Handoffs**: Smooth transitions between agents
- **Documentation**: Agents find and use reorganized documentation correctly

## üîß Test Execution Plan

### Week 1: Individual Agent Testing
- Test each enhanced agent individually
- Verify new documentation structure works
- Validate token usage efficiency

### Week 2: Multi-Agent Workflow Testing  
- Test orchestrator coordination
- Verify agent handoffs work smoothly
- Test complex multi-agent tasks

### Week 3: Real-World Usage
- Use agents for actual POWLAX development tasks
- Monitor performance and communication quality
- Gather feedback on any remaining issues

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Rollback Plan

If testing reveals issues:
1. **Documentation Issues**: Adjust file paths in agent instructions
2. **Context Loading Problems**: Modify `.bmad-core/context/POWLAX-AGENT-QUICK-CONTEXT.md`
3. **Communication Problems**: Update agent modification files
4. **Critical Failures**: Revert to previous `.claude.md` as backup
