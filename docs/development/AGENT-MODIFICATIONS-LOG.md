## üö® **CRITICAL UPDATES: Syntax Error Prevention & Quality Gate Enforcement** 
*Added: 2025-01-15*

### **Issue Analysis:**
During development environment setup, systematic issues were discovered:
- **powlax-frontend-developer** generated components with JSX syntax errors
- **powlax-master-controller** failed to enforce quality gates
- Build failures caused 4+ hours of debugging and environment breakdown
- Multiple components affected: `GlobalSearch.tsx`, `ThemeToggle.tsx`, `OnboardingContext.tsx`, `WelcomeModal.tsx`

### **Critical Pattern Identified:**
**JSX Quote Escaping Errors:**
- Generated: `className=\"fixed inset-0\"` ‚ùå
- Required: `className="fixed inset-0"` ‚úÖ
- Generated: `content: 'You\\'re All Set!'` ‚ùå
