# POWLAX-USA Lacrosse Negotiation Strategy

## Executive Summary

This negotiation strategy leverages Hormozi's five tactics (BATNA, Anchoring, MESO, Reciprocity, and Framing) combined with POWLAX's proven track record to secure optimal partnership terms with USA Lacrosse. The strategy positions POWLAX as the inevitable solution that saves USA Lacrosse $3.75M while delivering immediate value to 400,000 members.

## Pre-Negotiation Preparation

### 1. Establish Your BATNA (Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement)

**Your Strong BATNA Position:**
- Continue independent growth (current trajectory)
- Partner with Canadian Lacrosse Association
- License to IMG Academy or other elite programs
- Direct-to-consumer at $20/month to 20,000 users = $4.8M/year
- International expansion (UK, Australia lacrosse markets)

**Key Message**: "We're having similar conversations with other organizations. USA Lacrosse makes the most sense given our shared mission, but we have multiple paths to scale."

### 2. Gather Your Proof Arsenal

**Quantitative Proof:**
- **2,800+ coaches across 47 U.S. states + DC**
- **30 countries with active users**
- **Only 3 states without POWLAX coaches** (AK, HI, WY)
- Cost savings data: Coaches save 10+ hours/month
- Performance improvements: Teams using POWLAX win championships (TJ Celona's first district title)

**Qualitative Proof:**
- **50-year veteran**: "Patrick Chapla is THE BEST source for Lacrosse analysis" - David Fink
- **Hampton U. Head Coach**: "POWLAX teaches the how and why, not just the what" - Chazz Woodson
- **Championship results**: "POWLAX was instrumental in helping us win our first-ever district title" - TJ Celona
- **Parent validation**: "After a Skills Academy workout my son lit up—like he'd unlocked a secret code" - Todd Decker
- **30+ year coach**: "Today's players need to know why—POWLAX is the best I've ever seen at teaching it" - Mark

**Strategic Leverage Points:**
- Covers 94% of U.S. states (47/50)
- International presence proves scalability
- Trusted by coaches from youth to college level
- Parents actively endorsing (not just coaches)

### 3. Build Your Negotiation Team

**Your Team Roles:**
- **Lead Negotiator**: You (vision holder, relationship builder)
- **Technical Advisor**: CTO/Dev lead (demonstrates platform capabilities)
- **Financial Advisor**: CFO/Advisor (runs numbers in real-time)
- **Strategic Advisor**: Board member/mentor (provides gravitas)

## The Negotiation Playbook

### Phase 1: Setting the Stage (First Meeting)

#### Opening Moves
1. **Demonstrate Platform Live** (10 minutes)
   - Show drill→strategy connections
   - Display mobile experience
   - Highlight unique features they can't build

2. **Present Social Proof** (5 minutes)
   - "We're already trusted by 2,800 coaches across 47 states and 30 countries"
   - Show testimonial video: "David Fink, with 50 years in lacrosse, calls us THE BEST source for lacrosse analysis"
   - "TJ Celona just won his first district title using POWLAX strategies"
   - "Only Alaska, Hawaii, and Wyoming don't have POWLAX coaches yet"

3. **Frame the Opportunity** (10 minutes)
   - "USA Lacrosse can lead the digital transformation of lacrosse"
   - "Your 60% price increase needs to deliver 200% more value"
   - "We make you heroes to 400,000 members overnight"

#### The Anchor Drop
"Based on our analysis and what similar platforms charge, we typically price at $15 per member annually. However, given our shared mission and the scale USA Lacrosse brings, we've prepared three partnership structures..."

*[Let them recover from the $6M anchor]*

### Phase 2: MESO Presentation (Multiple Equivalent Simultaneous Offers)

**Present Three Options:**

**Option A: "The Performance Partnership"**
- $8/member with performance escalators
- "You pay more as we deliver more value"
- Frame: "Aligned incentives for mutual success"

**Option B: "The Innovation Alliance"**
- $6/member + $1M innovation fund
- "We co-develop the future of lacrosse together"
- Frame: "R&D partnership, not vendor relationship"

**Option C: "The Equity Play"**
- $4/member + 15% equity in USA Lacrosse Digital
- "True strategic partnership"
- Frame: "Building long-term value together"

**The Question**: "Which of these resonates most with your board's vision?"

### Phase 3: Reciprocity Dance

#### Your Concession Ladder
1. **Big Move First**: Drop from $15 to $12 ("I want this to work")
2. **They Counter**: Probably at $3-4
3. **Medium Move**: Add fast deployment (3 vs 6 months)
4. **They Move**: Up to $5
5. **Small Moves**: Add dedicated support, custom features
6. **Final Position**: Land at $7-8 with value adds

#### Reciprocity Phrases
- "If I can get approval to drop to $10, can you commit to a 3-year term?"
- "I'll include the innovation fund if you can move to $7"
- "Help me help you - what would make $8 work?"

### Phase 4: Handling Objections

#### "That's more than we budgeted"
**Response**: "I understand. Let's look at the ROI. You're investing $3.2M to save $3.75M immediately, plus avoiding $735K annually. Where else can you get 117% return year one?"

#### "We could build this ourselves"
**Response**: "Absolutely, and I respect that option. Our analysis shows it would take 24 months and $4.35M. More importantly, you'd miss two seasons of member value. Can USA Lacrosse afford to wait while others move forward?"

#### "We need board approval"
**Response**: "Of course. What information would help the board see this as the investment it is? I have testimonials from coaches with 30-50 years experience calling POWLAX 'the best they've ever seen.' We're already in 47 states - the board can call any of those 2,800 coaches. Would a pilot program with 10,000 members help demonstrate value?"

#### "The price per member seems high"
**Response**: "Let's reframe this. Netflix charges $15/month for entertainment. We're charging $0.67/month to revolutionize how kids learn lacrosse. Parents spend $200 on a stick - this is 4% of that for year-round development."

### Phase 5: Creating Urgency

#### Time-Based Urgency
- "Our development roadmap is booking up. Starting in Q1 vs Q3 means your members get value before next season."
- "We're finalizing our exclusive partnership strategy. First mover gets preferred terms."
- "Your 60% price increase is announced. Members expect immediate value."

#### Competitive Urgency
- "IMG Academy has expressed interest in our platform"
- "Hockey Canada just launched something similar - lacrosse can't fall behind"
- "Every month delayed is 33,000 kids not getting proper development"

### Phase 6: Closing Tactics

#### The Assumptive Close
"So we'll start with the Performance Partnership at $8/member. I'll have our team begin the USA Lacrosse integration next week. What's the best email for the contract?"

#### The Alternative Choice Close
"Would you prefer to announce this at your annual convention or start with a soft launch to coaches first?"

#### The Scarcity Close
"We can only take on one major partnership this year due to development resources. Should I tell the other organizations we're moving forward with USA Lacrosse?"

## Negotiation Scenarios & Responses

### Scenario 1: They Love It But Want to Start Small
**Your Response**: "I appreciate the cautious approach. Let's do a 90-day pilot with 50,000 members at $6/member. But here's the thing - when it succeeds, we move to full deployment at $8/member. Deal?"

### Scenario 2: They Want Everything for $2/member
**Your Response**: "I understand budget constraints. At $2/member, I can offer basic drill access - essentially our free tier. To include strategies, analytics, and support, we need to be at $6 minimum. What features are most critical to your members?"

### Scenario 3: They Want to Delay Decision
**Your Response**: "I respect the need for diligence. Can we agree on a 30-day exclusive negotiation period? I'll hold off other partnerships while you evaluate. In exchange, I need a commitment to decide by [date]."

### Scenario 4: They Bring in Procurement
**Your Response**: Switch to ROI/TCO language. Show the build vs buy analysis. Focus on risk mitigation and proven platform. Offer performance guarantees.

## Power Testimonials for Key Moments

### When They Question Your Expertise
**Deploy**: "David Fink, with 50 years as player, coach, official, and administrator, says 'Patrick Chapla is THE BEST source for Lacrosse analysis... he breaks advanced concepts into building blocks.'"

### When They Doubt Parent Buy-In

### When They Question Results
**Deploy**: "TJ Celona's team won their first-ever district title using POWLAX. Chase Witherow used it for championship-level defensive execution at William Penn. These aren't promises - they're proven results."

### When They Think It's Too Complex
**Deploy**: "Tim Ryan said it best: 'Kids grasp it quickly.' Mark Gianoni's visual learners saw huge improvements just from watching videos before practice. Bill Cosentino at St. Joseph's College just sends the films - players come ready."

### When They Want Authenticity
**Deploy**: "Brendan Maney nailed it: 'It's not perfect. It's authentic... It's honest, and I think that honesty is attractive.' That's why 2,800 coaches trust us."
