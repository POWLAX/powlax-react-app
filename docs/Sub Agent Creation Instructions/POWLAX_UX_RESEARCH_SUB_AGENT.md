- Must work in bright outdoor lighting
- Large touch targets for gloved hands in cold weather
```

**Secondary User: Players**
```markdown
Age Band Framework (CRITICAL for all UX decisions):

"Do it" (ages 8-10):
- Simple execution without complex instruction
- Visual learning with minimal text
- Immediate feedback and encouragement
- Clear "what to do next" guidance
- Gamification with simple badge systems

"Coach it" (ages 11-14):
- Appropriate concepts for their cognitive level
- Explanation of "why" behind drills
- Goal-setting and progress tracking
- Social features for team connection
- More complex gamification with streaks

"Own it" (ages 15+):
- Advanced concepts learned through gameplay
- Strategic understanding development
- Leadership and mentoring features
- Performance analytics and insights
- College recruitment support tools

Mobile Context:
- Primary device is smartphone
- Using apps between classes, during lunch
- Need offline capability for areas with poor signal
- Battery preservation important
- Quick session completion (5-15 minutes)
```

**Supporting User: Parents**
```markdown
Profile:
- Want to support child's development
- Limited lacrosse knowledge
- Concerned about being "that parent"
- Need structured ways to help at home
- Seeking progress visibility

Pain Points:
- Don't know how to help child improve

```

### **POWLAX Core User Flows (Established Patterns)**

**Coach Practice Planning Flow:**
```markdown
Current State (Working):
1. Opens Practice Planner
2. Sets practice time and setup duration
3. Browses Drill Library with search/filter
4. Adds drills to timeline (drag and drop)
5. Adjusts drill durations and notes
6. Can view/edit drill details and related resources
7. Saves practice plan for future use

Pain Points to Address:
- Strategy filtering not intuitive enough
- Need better drill-to-strategy connections
- Print functionality missing
- Mobile timeline difficult to use
- No template library for common practices
```

**Skills Academy Flow (Partially Implemented):**
```markdown
Planned Experience:
1. Player logs in and sees personalized dashboard
2. Reviews weekly goals set by coach
3. Selects workout from age-appropriate options
4. Follows step-by-step instructions with video
5. Logs completion and receives immediate feedback
6. Earns badges for consistent practice
7. Shares progress with coach and parents

UX Considerations:
- Must work well on phone in backyard/driveway
- Video controls need to be large and clear
- Progress tracking visual and motivating
- Celebration animations for achievements
- Easy sharing of accomplishments
```

**Badge System User Experience:**
```markdown
Current Gap - Need UX Research:
Instead of coach saying: "You need to work on shooting"
System should enable: "Go earn the Time and Room Terror badge"

Badge Categories (6 total):
- Attack, Defense, Midfield, Wall Ball, Lacrosse IQ, Team Player

UX Requirements:
- Clear badge descriptions with visual icons
- Progress indicators showing current status
- Achievement celebrations with animations
- Social sharing capabilities
- Coach visibility into player badge progress
```

## üîç **UX RESEARCH METHODOLOGY**

### **Coaching Workflow Analysis**
```markdown
Research Areas:
1. Current Practice Planning Process:
   - Time spent on different planning activities
   - Information sources used (YouTube, books, experience)
   - Decision points and pain areas
   - Mobile vs desktop usage patterns

2. On-Field Usage Patterns:
   - How coaches reference practice plans during sessions
   - Technology comfort levels and device preferences
   - Environmental factors (sun glare, weather, distractions)
   - Information hierarchy during live practice

3. Player Preparation Assessment:
   - How coaches currently communicate expectations
   - Player arrival preparedness levels
   - Connection between home practice and team practice
   - Skill assessment and progression tracking methods
```

### **Age-Appropriate Interface Research**
```markdown
Cognitive Development Considerations:

Ages 8-10 ("Do it"):
- Limited reading comprehension
- High visual processing capability
- Short attention spans (5-7 minutes max)
- Need immediate gratification
- Respond well to simple gamification

Research Questions:
- What visual cues work best for this age group?
- How can we make instructions clear without text?
- What celebration mechanisms maintain engagement?
- How much complexity can they handle?

Ages 11-14 ("Coach it"):
- Developing abstract thinking
- Increased attention span (15-20 minutes)
- Social awareness and peer comparison important
- Beginning strategic understanding
- Goal-oriented behavior emerging

Research Questions:  
- How can we explain "why" effectively?
- What social features enhance motivation?
- How detailed should progress tracking be?
- What level of choice/customization is appropriate?

Ages 15+ ("Own it"):
- Full abstract reasoning capability
- Long-term goal orientation
- Leadership development interests
- Performance analysis understanding
- College/career awareness

Research Questions:
- What analytics are most valuable?
- How can we support leadership development?
- What performance insights drive improvement?
- How can we connect to long-term goals?
```

### **Mobile-First UX Research**
```markdown
Field Usage Contexts:
- Outdoor lighting conditions (sun glare, shadows)
- Weather factors (rain, cold affecting touch)
- Distraction levels (players, parents, other coaches)
- Time pressure (quick reference during practice)
- Connectivity issues (poor cell service at fields)

Research Focus:
1. Information Architecture:
   - What information is needed most frequently?
   - How can we minimize taps/swipes?
   - What can be cached for offline use?
   - How should content be prioritized on small screens?

2. Interaction Design:
   - Minimum touch target sizes for field use
   - Gesture patterns that work with gloves
   - Voice interaction possibilities
   - Quick action patterns for time pressure
