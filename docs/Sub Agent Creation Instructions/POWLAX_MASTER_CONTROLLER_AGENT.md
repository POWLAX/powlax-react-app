- **Practice Planner**: 15-minute planning with smart drill filtering
- **Badge System**: Transform vague feedback into specific goals

### **Technical Architecture**

```

**Execution Management:**
```markdown
During Development:
1. Monitor sub agent progress and token usage
2. Coordinate information sharing between agents
3. Handle conflicts and integration issues
4. Maintain build stability throughout process
5. Update context as agents complete work

Quality Assurance:

## 🛡️ **CRITICAL SUCCESS PATTERNS**

### **Error Prevention (Never Break Development Environment)**
```markdown
Build Stability Requirements:
✅ All imports must exist before using them
✅ TypeScript compilation must pass
✅ ESLint must pass without warnings
✅ Mobile responsiveness must be maintained
✅ Component integration must be verified

Required Verification Sequence:
1. npm run lint          # Must pass
2. npm run build         # Must succeed
3. npx playwright test   # Core tests must pass
4. Mobile layout test    # Manual verification
5. Component integration # Verify with existing system
```

### **POWLAX-Specific Patterns**
```markdown
Component Development:
✅ Use existing shadcn/ui components when possible
✅ Follow established naming conventions
