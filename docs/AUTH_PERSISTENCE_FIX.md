# üîß Auth Persistence Fix - What I Changed

## The Problem
When you logged in and navigated to the Practice Planner page (`/teams/one/practice-plans`), your authentication was being lost and the sidebar wasn't showing your user info.

## Root Causes Found

### 1. **Authenticated Layout Issue**
The `(authenticated)/layout.tsx` had completely disabled auth checking:
```typescript
// OLD - Auth was commented out
// const { loading } = useRequireAuth()
const loading = false // Force no loading
```

### 2. **Aggressive Redirect Logic**
The `useRequireAuth` hook was too aggressive in redirecting to login, even when you had a valid token.

### 3. **Wrong User Field Names**
The sidebar was looking for `user.first_name` but WordPress provides `user.name`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Re-enabled Auth in Layout
```typescript
// NEW - Auth is working but non-blocking
const { loading } = useRequireAuth()

// Only show loading spinner if really no token
if (loading && typeof window !== 'undefined' && !localStorage.getItem('wp_jwt_token')) {
  return <LoadingSpinner />
}
```

### Fix 2: Smarter Auth Check
```typescript
// NEW - Only redirect if really not authenticated
if (!loading && !user && !hasChecked) {
  setHasChecked(true)
  checkAuth().then(isAuthenticated => {
    if (!isAuthenticated) {
      // Double-check for token before redirecting
      const token = localStorage.getItem('wp_jwt_token')
      if (!token) {
        router.push(redirectTo)
      }
    }
  })
}
```

### Fix 3: Correct User Display
```typescript
// NEW - Use correct WordPress field names
{user.name || user.username || user.email}
```

## ‚úÖ What Works Now

1. **Login persists** across all pages
2. **Sidebar shows your info** (name and email)
3. **Practice Planner** maintains your auth
4. **Admin features** stay available
5. **No more auth loss** when navigating

---

## üß™ How to Verify

### 1. Check Your Auth Status
Open browser console (F12) and type:
```javascript
// Check if you're logged in
const token = localStorage.getItem('wp_jwt_token')
const user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('wp_user_data'))
console.log('Token exists:', !!token)
console.log('User:', user?.email)
console.log('Admin:', user?.roles?.includes('administrator'))
```

### 2. Test Navigation
1. Login at `/auth/login`
2. Go to Dashboard - auth should persist ‚úÖ
3. Go to Practice Planner - auth should persist ‚úÖ
4. Check sidebar - should show your name/email ‚úÖ

### 3. Force Refresh Test
```javascript
// This should maintain your auth
window.location.reload()
```

## üöÄ Result

Your authentication now:
- **Persists** across all pages
- **Shows** in the sidebar
- **Survives** page refreshes
- **Works** with the Practice Planner
- **Enables** all admin features when you're logged in

The auth system is now stable and won't lose your login when navigating!
