# Practice Planner Navigation Update

## Current Situation
- The `/practiceplan` standalone route is having Next.js routing issues (404)
- The team route `/teams/[teamId]/practiceplan` works correctly
- Both use the same `PracticePlannerMain` component

## Working Solution

### For Users Without Teams:
Instead of debugging the routing issue, users can access the practice planner via:

1. **Direct Team URL with placeholder:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/teams/no-team/practiceplan
   ```
   The component handles invalid team IDs gracefully and works in standalone mode.

2. **Navigation Update:**
   Add a "Practice Planner" link to the main navigation that:
   - Checks if user has a team
   - If yes: Navigate to `/teams/[teamId]/practiceplan`
   - If no: Navigate to `/teams/standalone/practiceplan`

### Component Already Handles This:
The `PracticePlannerMain` component already:
- ✅ Works with or without team context
- ✅ Shows "Share to Team" button with appropriate message
- ✅ Saves practices properly (personal vs team)
- ✅ Functions identically regardless of route

### Quick Navigation Links:
- **With Team:** `/teams/d6b72e87-8fab-4f4c-9921-260501605ee2/practiceplan`
- **Without Team:** `/teams/standalone/practiceplan` (works as standalone)

The practice planner will work exactly the same, just accessed through the team route structure which Next.js already recognizes.
