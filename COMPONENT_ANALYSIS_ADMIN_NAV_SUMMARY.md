## üîê ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL ANALYSIS

### Permission Hierarchy
```yaml
administrator:
  - Access Level: Full system access
  - Components: All 15 admin/navigation components
  - Special Features: Role viewer, bulk operations, system analytics
  - Security: Bypasses most restrictions, audit logging required

club_director:  
  - Access Level: Organization-scoped administration
  - Components: 8 admin components (limited scope)
  - Features: Club/team management, user management within club
  - Restrictions: Cannot access system-wide analytics

team_coach:
  - Access Level: Team-scoped administration  
  - Components: 3 admin components (team-focused)
  - Features: Team roster, magic links for team members
  - Restrictions: Cannot modify user roles or access analytics

player/parent:
  - Access Level: Navigation only
  - Components: 2 navigation components
  - Features: Basic navigation, no admin tools
  - Restrictions: Admin section hidden entirely
```

### Security Implementation
**Role Verification Pattern:**
```typescript
// Security check in RoleViewerSelector
const isAdmin = user?.roles?.includes('administrator') || user?.roles?.includes('admin')
if (!mounted || !isAdmin) {
  return null // Hide component entirely
}

// Admin section visibility in SidebarNavigation  
{isActualAdmin && !isViewingAs && (
  <AdminSection /> // Only show to actual admins, not when viewing as other role
)}
```

## üöÄ NAVIGATION DATA FLOW ANALYSIS

### Desktop Navigation (SidebarNavigation)
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Auth] --> B[Role Check]
    B --> C{Is Admin?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Show Admin Section]
    C -->|No| E[Standard Navigation]
    D --> F[Admin Tools Access]
    E --> G[Basic Navigation]
    F --> H[Management Pages]
    G --> I[User Pages]
```

### Mobile Navigation (BottomNavigation)  
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Page Context] --> B{Full Screen?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Collapsible Mode]
    B -->|No| D[Standard Mode]
    C --> E[Menu Button]
    D --> F[Always Visible]
    E --> G[Expand/Collapse]
    F --> H[Direct Navigation]
```

### Role-Based Navigation Logic
**Navigation Item Filtering:**
- **Standard Users**: Dashboard, Teams, Academy, Resources
- **Coaches**: + Practice Planner access
- **Admins**: + Management, Drill Editor, Sync, WP Import
- **View-As Mode**: Admin tools hidden when viewing as other role

## üîß ADMIN TOOL USAGE PATTERNS  

### User Management Workflow
```yaml
Primary Flow:
  1. Admin ‚Üí Management Tab ‚Üí Users Tab
  2. UsersTabContent ‚Üí Search/Filter users  
  3. Select user ‚Üí CompleteUserEditor
  4. Edit across 6 tabs (Profile, Auth, Membership, Team, Family, Activity)
  5. Save with change tracking and audit logging

Bulk Operations:
  1. Admin ‚Üí Users ‚Üí Bulk Operations Panel
  2. Apply filters ‚Üí Select users ‚Üí Choose operation
  3. Execute with progress tracking and error handling
  4. Review results and handle failures

CSV Operations:
  1. Export: Configure fields ‚Üí Select users ‚Üí Generate CSV
  2. Import: Upload CSV ‚Üí Validate data ‚Üí Import with conflict resolution
```

### Magic Link Authentication Flow
```yaml
Generation:
  1. Admin ‚Üí Magic Links Tab ‚Üí Generate Link
  2. Select user ‚Üí Set expiration ‚Üí Create link
  3. Copy link ‚Üí Send to user manually

Usage:
  1. User clicks magic link ‚Üí Token validation
  2. Auto-login if valid ‚Üí Redirect to specified page
  3. Mark token as used ‚Üí Prevent reuse

Management:
  1. Admin views all links with status (Active/Used/Expired)
  2. Revoke unused links ‚Üí Cleanup expired links
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY & RLS COMPLIANCE

### Authentication Security
**Role Verification:**
- All admin components check actual user roles, not viewing roles
- Components return null if user lacks required permissions
- Admin section completely hidden from non-admin users

**Magic Link Security:**
- Token-based with expiration timestamps
- Single-use enforcement (marked used after click)  
- Secure token generation with sufficient entropy
- Admin-only generation with audit trails

**Data Access Security:**
- RLS policies enforced through Supabase queries
- User data editing restricted by role hierarchy
- Audit logging for sensitive operations (user edits, role changes)

### Potential Security Issues
```yaml
RoleViewerSelector:
  - Issue: Role switching without activity logging
  - Risk: Admin actions while viewing as other role not tracked
  - Recommendation: Add audit trail for role switches

CompleteUserEditor:  
  - Issue: Change tracking but no approval workflow
  - Risk: Immediate user data changes without oversight
  - Recommendation: Add approval process for sensitive changes

MagicLinkPanel:
  - Issue: Contains hardcoded mock data
  - Risk: Demo data in production could create false positives
  - Recommendation: Remove all mock data creation
```

  - Violates established no-mock-data policy
  - Could cause confusion between test and real data
```

### Security Improvements Needed
```yaml
Audit Logging:
  - Missing: Role switch audit trail in RoleViewerSelector
  - Missing: Bulk operation detailed logs
  - Missing: Magic link generation/usage logging

Access Control:

  - Needed: IP-based restrictions for sensitive operations

Data Protection:
  - Needed: Encryption for CSV exports containing PII
  - Needed: Data retention policies for audit logs  
  - Needed: GDPR compliance features (data export/deletion)
```
