# Skills Academy Video Fix Summary

## üî¥ THE PROBLEM
Videos are showing "Sorry - This video does not exist" because the application is using **fallback data with fake Vimeo IDs (like 100000001)** instead of the real video URLs from the database.

## üîç ROOT CAUSE DISCOVERED
**Row Level Security (RLS) is blocking anonymous users from accessing the `skills_academy_drills` table!**

- The database HAS the correct video URLs (e.g., `https://vimeo.com/1000143414`)
- The server-side queries with service role key CAN access the data
- The client-side queries with anon key CANNOT access the data
- This causes the app to fall back to mock data with fake video IDs

## ‚úÖ THE SOLUTION

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended for Development)
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run the SQL from `URGENT_FIX_RLS_PERMISSIONS.sql`
4. This will disable RLS on the Skills Academy tables

### Option 2: Manual Fix
Run these commands in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
ALTER TABLE skills_academy_drills DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE skills_academy_workouts DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE skills_academy_series DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

## üß™ HOW TO VERIFY THE FIX

### Test 1: Database Query
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT id, title, video_url FROM skills_academy_drills LIMIT 5;
```
You should see real video URLs like `https://vimeo.com/1000143414`

### Test 2: API Test
```bash
curl -s "https://avvpyjwytcmtoiyrbibb.supabase.co/rest/v1/skills_academy_drills?limit=1" \
  -H "apikey: YOUR_ANON_KEY" | jq
```
Should return drill data, not an empty array

### Test 3: Application Test
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/skills-academy/workout/1
2. You should see actual Vimeo videos loading
3. The console should NOT show "Using fallback drills"

## üìä EVIDENCE OF THE ISSUE

### What We Found:
- ‚úÖ Database has 167 drills with valid video_url and vimeo_id fields
- ‚úÖ Service role queries return the data correctly
- ‚ùå Anonymous role queries return empty arrays `[]`
- ‚ùå This triggers fallback to mock data with IDs like 100000001
- ‚ùå Vimeo rejects these fake IDs with "Sorry - This video does not exist"

### Console Logs Showing the Issue:
```
üì° Fetching drills with IDs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
üì° Drills query result: {drills: [], drillsError: null, drillsLength: 0}
‚ö†Ô∏è Skills Academy drills table is empty, using fallback drills
üõ†Ô∏è Creating 5 fallback drills for workout 1
```

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

1. **Immediate**: Run the SQL fix in Supabase Dashboard
2. **Verify**: Test that videos now load properly
3. **Long-term**: Consider proper RLS policies for production:
   - Public read access for drills/workouts
   - Authenticated write access for user progress
   - Admin-only access for content management

## üìù FILES ALREADY UPDATED

The following files have been updated to support video URLs properly:
- ‚úÖ `/src/app/(authenticated)/skills-academy/workout/[id]/page.tsx` - Uses video_url field
- ‚úÖ `/src/hooks/useSkillsAcademyWorkouts.ts` - Fetches and maps video_url
- ‚úÖ Video extraction function prioritizes video_url over legacy fields

Once you run the SQL fix, the videos should work immediately without any code changes!
