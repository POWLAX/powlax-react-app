## Drill Sequence Mapping Strategy

Each drill in the CSV has numbers indicating its position in specific workout variants. The mapping works as follows:

1. **Sequence Numbers**: The number in each workout column indicates the drill's position in that workout
2. **Empty Cells**: Mean the drill is not included in that workout variant
3. **Workout Variants**: Are identified by Series + Duration + Coaching status

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Upload Missing Drills
1. Run `scripts/upload-missing-wall-ball-drills.sql`
2. Verify all 38 drills are inserted
3. Confirm video URLs and Vimeo IDs are properly extracted

### Phase 2: Update Workout Variants with Drill Mappings
1. Query each workout variant by series_name + duration + coaching status
2. For each variant, find matching CSV column
3. Build drill_ids array based on sequence numbers from CSV
4. Update wall_ball_workout_variants.drill_ids with proper drill IDs

### Phase 3: Verification
1. Ensure all variants have correct drill_ids arrays
2. Verify sequence ordering matches CSV
3. Test that points can be awarded based on drill completion

## SQL Generation for Phase 2

The drill-to-variant mapping will require:
```sql
-- Example: Update Master Fundamentals 5-minute coaching variant
UPDATE wall_ball_workout_variants 
SET drill_ids = ARRAY[
    (SELECT id FROM wall_ball_drill_library WHERE drill_name = 'Overhand'),
    (SELECT id FROM wall_ball_drill_library WHERE drill_name = 'Quick Sticks'),
    -- ... more drills in sequence order
]
WHERE series_id = (SELECT id FROM wall_ball_workout_series WHERE series_name = 'Master Fundamentals')
  AND duration_minutes = 5 
  AND has_coaching = true;
```

## Next Steps

1. **Review and approve** the upload SQL script
2. **Execute** the drill uploads
3. **Generate** the variant mapping SQL based on CSV sequence data
4. **Test** the complete system with points/gamification integration
