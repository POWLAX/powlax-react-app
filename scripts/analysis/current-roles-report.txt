WordPress Alignment Check:
- Current value: "admin"
- WordPress standard: "administrator"
- Status: ⚠️  NEEDS MIGRATION
- Action required: Update role from "admin" to "administrator"

=== WORDPRESS ROLE VERIFICATION ===
✅ WordPress uses "administrator" as the standard admin role value
✅ Migration to "administrator" aligns with WordPress conventions
✅ This ensures future WordPress integration compatibility
⚠️  Current "admin" value was likely an incorrect abbreviation

=== MIGRATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT ===
Users affected by migration: 1 (Patrick only)
Database records to update: 1
Risk level: LOW (single user, simple string update)
Rollback complexity: SIMPLE (single UPDATE statement)

=== BACKUP STATUS ===
✅ Users table backup created: users-table-backup-2025-08-14_111801.sql
✅ Rollback script generated: role-migration-rollback.sql
✅ All backups verified and ready

=== NEXT STEPS (PHASE 2) ===
1. Execute database migration (single UPDATE statement)
2. Verify Patrick's role = "administrator"
3. Test authentication functionality
4. Confirm WordPress alignment
5. Proceed to code updates (Phase 3+)
