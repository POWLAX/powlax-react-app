The rules for this offense are as follows. 

The players are divided into midfield and attack groups of 3 players.
Motions are movements made when your group has the ball -  rotations are movements made with the other group has the ball.

We are using push pull -  motions -  exclusively. So if a player in your group is dodging -  and you are behind them -  they will pull you and  you must follow. If you are in front of them they will push you into the middle. The crease player will always float out the back side.

Dodgers can go any direction -  but if they dodge out of their box -  they need to get back to the crease once they move the ball.

Wild Cat Alley Dodge Trap and Rotate vs 2-3-1,
As MR goes down the alley -  D6 will hold in his position trying to deter the dodge.  If he must slide -  it should be an attempt to trap MR.  
Once D6 has slid and the ball is passed -  the rotation will begin with the Cat rotating to A2 and the Hawk rotating down to M1 on the crease.  
*Notice that this keeps -  D4 and M1 in place on the backside.
"""If a team is trying to get to the middle of the field with their strong hands -  we can switch from funneling to the middle to pushing them down the alley.  When MR receives the ball in the 3 position -  M3 will take away their right hand sweep and push him down the alley.

If the defensive team lines up “Hip to Hip” on both sides -  the FO specialist will have to pull it to himself where he has space.
