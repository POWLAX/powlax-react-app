# POWLAX React App - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 **What I (James - Dev Agent) Built Today**

I implemented a complete Skills Academy, Strategies/Concepts, and Gamification system for POWLAX. Everything is coded and ready - it just needs the Supabase tables populated with data.

## 🏗️ **Files I Created/Modified**

### **New Pages Created:**
```
✅ src/app/(authenticated)/skills-academy/workouts/page.tsx
✅ src/app/(authenticated)/skills-academy/progress/page.tsx
✅ src/app/(authenticated)/strategies/page.tsx
✅ src/app/(authenticated)/gamification/page.tsx
✅ src/app/skills-academy/page.tsx (public)
✅ src/app/strategies/page.tsx (public)
✅ src/app/gamification/page.tsx (public)
```

### **Supporting Infrastructure:**
```
✅ src/lib/vimeo-service.ts
✅ src/hooks/useGamificationData.ts
✅ src/components/ui/progress.tsx
✅ src/types/vimeo.ts
```

### **Enhanced Existing:**
```
✅ src/components/dashboards/ParentDashboard.tsx (added gamification)
```

## 🔌 **Supabase Integration Status**

### **What's Connected:**
1. **strategies_powlax** table - ✅ Working with 221 records
2. **skills_academy_drills** - ⏳ Table exists, awaiting data import
3. **skills_academy_workouts** - ⏳ Table exists, awaiting data import

### **Import Files Ready:**
- `skills_academy_complete_import.sql` - Contains 167 drills + 192 workouts
- `SKILLS_ACADEMY_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md` - Documentation for the import

## 🚦 **Current State**

### **Working Now:**
- All pages render with mock data
- Strategies show real data from database
- Navigation between all pages works
- Responsive design complete
- Gamification calculations ready

### **Needs Data Import:**
- Skills Academy workouts/drills
- User gamification tables (not created yet)

## 📝 **For Next AI Agent Session**

### **Immediate Tasks:**
1. Run `skills_academy_complete_import.sql` in Supabase
2. Verify pages display real Skills Academy data
3. Create user gamification tables
4. Test video playback with Vimeo URLs

### **Key Integration Points:**
- Vimeo service works with/without API key
- Point system: 6 types (lax_credit, attack_token, etc.)
- Ranks: Rookie → All-American (6 levels)
- Badges: Bronze/Silver/Gold tiers

### **Database Columns I'm Using:**

**skills_academy_workouts:**
- title, workout_type, duration_minutes, point_values, tags

**strategies_powlax:**
- strategy_name, strategy_categories, vimeo_link, lacrosse_lab_links
- see_it_ages, coach_it_ages, own_it_ages (for complexity)

## 🎮 **Gamification Implementation**

### **Point Distribution:**
```javascript
{
  lax_credit: "Universal points",
  attack_token: "Attack drills",
  defense_dollar: "Defense drills",
  midfield_medal: "Midfield drills",
  rebound_reward: "Wall ball",
  flex_points: "Self-guided"
}
```

### **Rank Thresholds:**
- Rookie: 0
- Starter: 500
- Varsity: 1,500
- All-Conference: 5,000
- All-State: 10,000
- All-American: 25,000

## 🔍 **Testing The Implementation**

### **Page Routes to Check:**
1. `/skills-academy` - Public marketing
2. `/strategies` - Browse strategies
3. `/gamification` - Point system overview
4. `/skills-academy/workouts` - Workout browser (auth)
5. `/skills-academy/progress` - Progress tracker (auth)
6. `/gamification` (auth) - Player dashboard

### **Look For:**
- Mock data on Skills Academy pages (until import)
- Real data on Strategies pages (221 records)
- Gamification cards in ParentDashboard
- Video embed functionality
