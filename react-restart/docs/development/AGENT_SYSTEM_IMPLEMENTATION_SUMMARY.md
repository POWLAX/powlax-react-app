## üîÑ **INTEGRATED WORKFLOW SOLUTION**

### **Three-Phase Development Approach:**

**Phase 1: Strategic Planning (BMad Framework)**
- Product Manager + Architect + UX Expert + Developer
- Requirements gathering and technical architecture
- Context package creation for implementation

**Phase 2: Safe Implementation (A4CC Framework)**  
- Domain-specific architects (UI, Database, Integration)
- Error-preventing implementation patterns
- Quality assurance integration

**Phase 3: Complex Coordination (Claude Code Sub Agents)**
- Specialized coordination for multi-system tasks
- Component Refactor, Database Migration, Integration agents
- Enterprise-level development capabilities

### **Agent Selection Decision Tree:**
```
Task Assessment:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Strategic/Planning? ‚Üí BMad Framework
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Implementation? ‚Üí A4CC Framework  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Complex Coordination? ‚Üí Sub Agent Framework
```
