## üéØ **VIDEO WORKFLOW ANALYSIS**

### **Core Sub Agent Workflow from Video:**

**Phase 1: Research & Planning**
```markdown
1. UX Research Agent (7 min, 53k tokens)
   - Comprehensive UX research 
   - Defines navigation and user experience
   - No visual design, just experience flow

2. Sprint Prioritizer Agent
   - Breaks implementation into small sprints
   - Creates execution roadmap for other agents
   - Chains from UX research output
```

**Phase 2: Design & Enhancement**
```markdown
3. UI Designer Agent 
   - Designs project UI using UX agent output
   - Creates component task list
   - Documentation-only (no implementation)

4. Whimsy Injector Agent
   - Adds micro-interactions and animations
   - Creates wireframes and detailed UI elements
   - "Master of digital delight"
```

**Phase 3: Implementation**
```markdown
5. Rapid Prototyper Agent
   - Establishes app foundation
   - Follows structured workflow design

6. Frontend Developer Agent (18 min, 130k tokens)
   - Full frontend implementation
   - Includes micro-interactions from Whimsy Injector
   - Polished, production-ready output
```

```

### **Key Innovations from Video:**

**Context Management:**
- Each sub agent gets 200k token window
- Context saved to MD files between agents
- Main session acts as controller/orchestrator

**Parallel Processing:**
- Multiple agents can work simultaneously
- Each maintains deep context for specialized work
- Returns only essential info to main session

**Checkpointing System:**
- Automatic branching at each prompt

## üìã **RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS**

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Create Main Controller Agent** with complete POWLAX context
2. **Extract BMad expertise** into specialized sub agent definitions
3. **Test workflow** with a simple POWLAX feature
4. **Validate quality integration** and build stability

### **Implementation Priority:**
1. Start with core sub agents (UX Research, Architecture, Frontend, Backend)
2. Add specialized agents (Testing, Quality) in phase 2
3. Expand with domain-specific agents as needed
4. Continuously optimize based on usage patterns

**Result:** A single, powerful agent system that leverages all existing BMad context while providing the coordination and quality assurance benefits of the A4CC system, but in a more integrated and efficient manner.
