## 🔄 **SUB AGENT TRACKING MECHANISMS**

### **Master Controller Tracking:**
The `powlax-master-controller` maintains awareness through:

**1. Context Loading:**
- Automatically loads complete POWLAX context on activation
- Reads current system architecture documentation
- Checks coordination logs for concurrent work
- Understands current development state

**2. Progress Monitoring:**
- Tracks sub agent activation and completion
- Monitors token usage across coordinated work
- Documents decisions made during development
- Updates system architecture with changes

**3. Quality Gate Documentation:**
- Records all quality gate results (lint, build, mobile testing)
- Documents component integration testing outcomes
- Tracks mobile responsiveness validation
- Maintains deployment readiness status

### **Sub Agent Self-Documentation:**
Each specialized sub agent updates:

**Progress Tracking:**
```markdown
## Work Session: [Date] [Time]
**Agent**: powlax-frontend-developer
**Task**: Create new-practice-planner mobile optimization
**Status**: In Progress | Completed | Blocked

**Changes Made:**
- Modified: src/components/practice-planner/DrillLibrary.tsx
- Created: src/components/practice-planner/new-DrillLibrary.tsx
- Updated: Mobile responsiveness for 375px screens

**Quality Gates:**
✅ npm run lint - Passed
✅ npm run build - Passed  
✅ Mobile responsive test - Passed
✅ Component integration - Passed

**Next Session Context:**
- Component ready for testing
- Integration with existing navigation complete
- Mobile optimization validated
```

## 🔍 **SESSION CONTINUITY SYSTEM**

### **Context Persistence:**
The sub agent system maintains context through:

**1. Master Controller Context Files:**
- Complete POWLAX project knowledge
- Current development state
- Outstanding tasks and priorities
- Component integration status

**2. Work Session Logs:**
- Detailed progress tracking per session
- Decisions made and rationale
- Quality verification results
- Handoff information for next session

**3. System State Documentation:**
- Current page/component status
- Database migration state
- Integration testing results
- Mobile optimization completion

### **Cross-Session Coordination:**
```markdown
## Session Handoff Protocol

**Previous Session Summary:**
- Agent: powlax-frontend-developer
- Completed: new-practice-planner basic structure
- Status: Ready for UX research validation
- Next: Needs powlax-ux-researcher for mobile field usage testing

**Context for Next Session:**
- Files modified: [list]
- Quality gates passed: [results]
- Integration points tested: [results]
- Outstanding work: [specific tasks]
```

## 📊 **PROGRESS TRACKING DASHBOARD**

### **Master Controller Status Tracking:**
```markdown
## Current POWLAX Development State

**Active Development:**
├── new-practice-planner: 85% complete (mobile optimization pending)
├── new-skills-academy: 40% complete (UX research in progress)  
├── new-navigation: Planning phase (sprint prioritization needed)
└── Database migrations: All current migrations applied

**Quality Status:**
├── Build Stability: ✅ All tests passing
├── Mobile Responsiveness: ⚠️ Some pages need optimization
├── Component Integration: ✅ All existing components working
└── Performance: ✅ Mobile load times < 3 seconds

**Next Priorities:**
1. Complete mobile optimization for new-practice-planner
2. Finish UX research for skills-academy age bands
3. Begin navigation system optimization
```

## 🔧 **RECOVERY & RESTART MECHANISMS**

### **Fresh Session Initialization:**
When starting a new development session, the Master Controller:

**1. Context Reconstruction:**
- Loads complete POWLAX project context
- Reviews coordination logs for current state
- Checks system architecture for recent changes
- Validates development environment status

**2. Work State Assessment:**
- Identifies incomplete tasks from previous sessions
- Reviews quality gate results and outstanding issues
- Determines optimal sub agent activation sequence
- Plans session priorities based on current state

**3. Coordination Setup:**
- Updates coordination log with session start
- Establishes communication channels with sub agents
- Sets up progress tracking for current session
- Prepares handoff documentation for session end

### **Error Recovery:**
```markdown
## Error Recovery Protocol

**Build Failures:**
1. Master Controller identifies failing components
2. Activates appropriate sub agent for fixes
3. Runs quality gates to verify resolution
4. Updates system documentation with fixes

**Context Loss:**
1. Master Controller reloads complete POWLAX context
2. Reviews coordination logs for recent work
3. Validates current system state
4. Continues from last documented checkpoint

**Agent Communication Failures:**
1. Master Controller handles sub agent coordination
2. Maintains progress tracking independently
3. Provides unified communication interface
4. Ensures no work is lost during transitions
