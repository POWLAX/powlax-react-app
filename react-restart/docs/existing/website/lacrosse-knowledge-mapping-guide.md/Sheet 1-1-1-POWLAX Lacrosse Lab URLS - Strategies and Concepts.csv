The players are divided into midfield and attack groups of 3 players.
Motions are movements made when your group has the ball -  rotations are movements made with the other group has the ball.

We are using push pull -  motions -  exclusively. So if a player in your group is dodging -  and you are behind them -  they will pull you and  you must follow. If you are in front of them they will push you into the middle. The crease player will always float out the back side.

Dodgers can go any direction -  but if they dodge out of their box -  they need to get back to the crease once they move the ball. 

The only rotation we are using is backside exchange linear exchange. So -  wherever the Dodge happens from -  the player on the opposite side of the field -  and the crease player will switch places."

3) If the ball is transferred from one side of X to another -  we will play the ball with as much pressure as possible.  If the ball is carried from one side of X to the other -  the on ball defenseman will play the ball the whole way while the other two low defenseman switch to occupy the 4 and 6 zones.  If the ball is passed from back left to back right or vice versa -  the Cat will the zone of the defenseman playing the ball.
4) Once the ball is passed up top -  the three low zones will snap back with as little movement as possible.  The players on the perimeter will bump the 4 or 6 zones back into the Cat Position.
5) If we trap at the 4 or 6 and the ball moves to the wing -  we will rotate with everyone except the backside low defender."

Defense/Wild Cat Zone/Wild Cat - Trapping and Rotating/,Wild Cat Alley Dodge Trap and Rotate vs 2-3-1,,"If a team is trying to get to the middle of the field with their strong hands -  we can switch from funneling to the middle to pushing them down the alley.  When MR receives the ball in the 3 position -  M3 will take away their right hand sweep and push him down the alley.
As MR goes down the alley -  D6 will hold in his position trying to deter the dodge.  If he must slide -  it should be an attempt to trap MR.  
Once D6 has slid and the ball is passed -  the rotation will begin with the Cat rotating to A2 and the Hawk rotating down to M1 on the crease.  
*Notice that this keeps -  D4 and M1 in place on the backside.
Once A2 passes to A1 -  D4 will naturally move out to play him.  D6 -  will move to the crease position to become the new Cat and push the Hawk back up to top center and the Cat will move to the 6 zone."

Defense/Wild Cat Zone/Wild Cat - Trapping and Rotating/,Wild Cat Funnel and Trap vs 2-3-1,,In the Wild Cat Zone -  our first point of emphasis is getting rid of strong handed dodges down the alleys from the high wings and top center.  Ideally -  we would rather push strong handed players to the middle to their weak hand -  rather than down the alley to their strong hands.  This will allow us to trap offensive players between the Hawk shorty zones by allowing them to turn in side and pouncing on them.

Defense/Wild Cat Zone/,Wild Cat String vs 2-3-1,,In the Wild Cat Zone -  the Hawk and Cat will string up to top center and down to X.   One of the main tenets of the zone is that we must have pressure back at X as we will only ever play X with one player.  There must be pressure because we will always try to trap on the corners.
