The rules for this offense are as follows. 

The players are divided into midfield and attack groups of 3 players.
Motions are movements made when your group has the ball -  rotations are movements made with the other group has the ball.

We are using push pull -  motions -  exclusively. So if a player in your group is dodging -  and you are behind them -  they will pull you and  you must follow. If you are in front of them they will push you into the middle. The crease player will always float out the back side.

Dodgers can go any direction -  but if they dodge out of their box -  they need to get back to the crease once they move the ball. 

The only rotation we are using is backside exchange linear exchange. So -  wherever the Dodge happens from -  the player on the opposite side of the field -  and the crease player will switch places.","[""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=7ztvLNlzQaAM5ECRK9Eg\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=rNf2I3YNj56OcfwCSEDi\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=abSVUhjsb6NSV8XI1ipG\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=NeaEqBJkXDx358GjlqyF\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=XHHNMqlDKKr5VH76QuZK\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=FtpyPAVRBpnLljq6b9Xp\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>""]"

Likewise -  perimeter players must communicate to the Tiger that a player is moving to the crease for them to cover.  HOUSE Players must cover backside cutters until they know the Tiger has taken responsibility to cover them. | There are any options to play the ball at X depending on what you’d like to do with personnel. I don’t like the idea of leaving a player at X to look back up through the field -  but you may want to hold the pipes.

Rules
1) If you need to help and rotate -  do it.
2) The 1 and 3 Zones should be the primary players playing the wings. | This diagram depicts the perimeter zones occupied by the House Players.  The 
1 Zone is Red -  
2 Zone is Orange -  
3 Zone is Grey -  
6 Zone is Yellow 
4 Zone is Green

All of these zones will help backside on the crease and rotate to mitigate threats. | When a ball carrier took the ball from one zone to the other -  the players in the House would pass the player off like a zone and then rotate if necessary behind them.

This is a play that Union used often. | As the ball swings in a 2-3-1 -  we have the option to play the ball at X.  If we don’t want to play the ball at X as the ball is swinging -  the 4 and 6 zones will hold their positions. | As the ball swings in a 2-3-1 -  we have the option to play the ball at X.  If we want to put pressure on -  who will play it will depend on whether the ball side low zone got pulled to the wing or not.  In this example -  the low zone gets pulled up and the opposite side moves to play the ball at X. | This diagram shows how the RIT House and 1 Zone matches up against a 3-1-2 swinging the ball.","[""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=OLcwPEKD478uwo8j453A\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=an1W37412dYeVEbEzLc9\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=JvCpwg0ONqefTADHDSo6\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=Yz3YeXI9T0J6Kd5HC1rc\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=Ga1ttvpfmobVsE4N4pW9\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=j5ideji0Hm9URQLMKqJ9\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=lJC36CTAz34Zs8TmpiB1\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=LhGx2HOP3ZUCZ4WuWvlO\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=gesoRwiF2jMvPz5PkiSC\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=7xUvfMLTiigHysNPlXmT\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>""]"

This helps to keep his defenseman away from the dodger. | 2 Man Game Concept - Fade / Drift

Players will fade to create space for when the dodger is running at them.  They will move on the edge of dangerous space and their defenseman will be in a tough decision of whether they should slide or not.  

The dodger should try to turn the corner and get to the middle of the field -  throw fakes to keep the slide away -  and pass if the slide comes. | 2 Man Game Concept - Give and Go.

A player on the crease executes a mirror by moving to the opposite the dodge.  The mirror works well because it puts a defensive player in a prime positon to slide. | 2 Man Game Concept - Overlap

An overlap is when the off ball player creates space by running to the outside of the ball carrier.  This is dangerous because the off-ball defenseman can execute a ""Free Double"" if the offensive players are not elusive.  A free double happens when an off-ball player can double the ball while being in a good off-ball position on their man. | 2 Man Game Concept - Pick

A pick is used to create an advantage for the ball carrier or the off ball players.  The off-ball player will stand still in the way of the on-ball defenseman.  The on ball defenseman will need to try to get around the pick and the off-ball player must decide whether the on ball player needs help. | A “Draft Cut” is when a player Cuts in the wake of another Cut. | A Mumbo is when an off ball offensive player seals their own Man into the Middle of the field for a player popping off the crease around them. | An “Off Ball Pick” happens when an off ball player impedes the Motion off an off ball player to create space for a teammate. | A seal is when an off ball offensive player impedes the movement of the defenseman off another off ball player.","[""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=Z2kgYCeYuETMCDSbSnQg\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=XeGBaagrFgUQ51EwCD2L\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=Q46W6F6QDGXBI0BGHTNl\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=ZoZhX6d5CCCEGKmloqIY\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=PzDjbVSbBoUkLZUFt6ia\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=yv6FGwQDjOrGTJueJxyp\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=YrmMwaaNYGhuKLxITCsV\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=cwCPkQF4hA1Ck9ycNxQ2\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=t5aLiwlI7OthmeTgn2x4\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=b1VtJIUltMcsdJV6H94R\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>""]"

1 Zone is Red -  
2 Zone is Orange -  
3 Zone is Grey -  
4 Zone is Green
5 Zone is Blue 
6 Zone is Yellow | In the Wild Cat Zone -  the Hawk and Cat will string up to top center and down to X.   One of the main tenets of the zone is that we must have pressure back at X as we will only ever play X with one player.  There must be pressure because we will always try to trap on the corners. | In Wild Cat -  we have 3 rules the effect how we play the ball at X.  
1) We will send 1 Player to play the ball at X with loads of pressure -  almost to the point of trying to get beat.  This player is always the Cat.
2) When the ball is at X -  the Hawk will be covering the player on the crease looking up field for cutters -  while the 4 and 6 Zones hold their positions looking to create traps at the pipes.
3) If the ball is transferred from one side of X to another -  we will play the ball with as much pressure as possible.  If the ball is carried from one side of X to the other -  the on ball defenseman will play the ball the whole way while the other two low defenseman switch to occupy the 4 and 6 zones.  If the ball is passed from back left to back right or vice versa -  the Cat will the zone of the defenseman playing the ball.
4) Once the ball is passed up top -  the three low zones will snap back with as little movement as possible.  The players on the perimeter will bump the 4 or 6 zones back into the Cat Position.
5) If we trap at the 4 or 6 and the ball moves to the wing -  we will rotate with everyone except the backside low defender. | If a team is trying to get to the middle of the field with their strong hands -  we can switch from funneling to the middle to pushing them down the alley.  When MR receives the ball in the 3 position -  M3 will take away their right hand sweep and push him down the alley.
As MR goes down the alley -  D6 will hold in his position trying to deter the dodge.  If he must slide -  it should be an attempt to trap MR.  
Once D6 has slid and the ball is passed -  the rotation will begin with the Cat rotating to A2 and the Hawk rotating down to M1 on the crease.  
*Notice that this keeps -  D4 and M1 in place on the backside.
Once A2 passes to A1 -  D4 will naturally move out to play him.  D6 -  will move to the crease position to become the new Cat and push the Hawk back up to top center and the Cat will move to the 6 zone. | Once we’ve trapped an off handed dodger on the sweep -  if he is able to make a pass to the adjacent -  we will rotate everyone except the low backside 4 or 6 zones.  In the example -  it is the 6 zone that will not rotate. | In the Wild Cat Zone -  our first point of emphasis is getting rid of strong handed dodges down the alleys from the high wings and top center.  Ideally -  we would rather push strong handed players to the middle to their weak hand -  rather than down the alley to their strong hands.  This will allow us to trap offensive players between the Hawk shorty zones by allowing them to turn in side and pouncing on them. | Once we’ve trapped an off handed dodger on the sweep -  if he is able to make a pass to the adjacent -  we will rotate everyone except the low backside 4 or 6 zones.  In the example -  it is the 6 zone that will not rotate.
Once there has been a rotation -  the players will do their best to get back into their original zones.","[""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=Pi6CsmPHzf7FQvA7MGiy\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=6w12KlTEZH4epa3BVns0\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=bRaeiajeLlkUZU67lpKN\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=7CKhJuUeogfGzJTzEWCj\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=UllWuw2XSg8byDJMo9bC\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=3yQwLls81IJq2aZoZ2iZ\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=HCfmU7u4KQDDzhfo6MNK\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=sHfbHV7XyCxXgPbSx9Xv\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=FsCtO9zgVT0vWwgQUEVt\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=X1VLkQZcZiYon93oTW8T\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=ReiErbED7k0GWNgq9QA2\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>""]"

This can be dangerous because it allows the off ball player to “free double” (when a defenseman can double the ball carrier while maintaining a good off ball position on their man).  The offense will move quickly and use flips or fake flips to manipulate the defenseman. | Pass Down Pick Down | The Weave Motion consists of consecutive pass down pick downs to opposite sides. | Although most 21-12 dodges are from the 1 position because wing dodges from the 2 are hard to keep symmetrical -  the Wing Dodge - Fade - Cut the Middle is the midfield motion used in the Cuse Offense with an added attackman. | The Top Center Cut is a simple rotation where then player top center or at X to the crease. | A “Clear Out” is when the nearest player in the other group will move to the crease but the other players will stay where they are. | The Clear Through Fill - Fill rotation clears out the entire side to allow dodgers to operate and it prepares for the next 21 Motion. | The Fade -  Push -  Cut the Middle Rotation is a part of the triangle offense and clears the side by moving away rather than moving to the middles. This creates a great opportunity with the backside player to cutting the middle. | Flares are a backside seal and pop to the top o the field.  It’s like a Mumbo -  but to the top. | The dodge -  follow -  float motion is the primary dodging motion in the triangle offense.  It’s simplicity makes it easy for players to understand when paired with the sweep - fade - float motion. | Dodge - Mirror - Fade is a 2 man mirror motion with a backside fade. | The sweep -  fade -  float motion is the primary dodging motion in the triangle offense.  It’s simplicity makes it easy for players to understand when paired with the dodge - follow - float motion. | The Sweep -  Pick -  Float motion used a top center pick and float from the crease. | The sweep -  shallow cut -  float motion can easily be paired with the dodge follow float motion so that the high player will always moves to the middle and the crease will always move to the backside. | This motion uses an up pick from the crease and a fade from the opposite top player.  The dodger can dodge down the alley or sweep. | The 21 Backside Exchange keeps the ball side outlet in front of the dodger for an easy redirect to the player poping off the crease. | The 21 Backside Exchange is dangerous against crease slides because the player who is supposed to slide ends up defending the next dodge. | In order to create a complete offense -  we must include dodges with all perimeter players in either set. For an example -  we will combine motions and that have the same rules into sets and give those sets a name. Like stated on the previous page -  it is important that the motions use similar rules so that off ball player can react quickly and efficiently once they understand how to play within the concepts.
Regular - All motions are “Push-Pull” motions.
21 Motions - Dodge - Follow - Float and Sweep - Fade - Float
12 Motion - Center Dodge : Dodge - Clear Through - Follow
12 Motion - Wing Dodge : Dodge - Follow - Hold and Dodge - Fade - Cut The Middle
Fade and Cut The Middle Rotations - The closest player in the opposite group will always fade (or Pop) to be the forward outlet (unless they are already out of the way). The backside player will always cut the middle. If they rotate early because they expect the dodge to go one way and it goes the other -  they should maintain their movements and get reset into a 21 or 12 set.
12 Rotation : Fade - Fade - Cut The Middle
21 Rotation : Backside Exchange","[""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=x3B5sOE9Od6XHtCW6FqC\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=VaAuMW9cduW6pb6xVqRK\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=nYK0L0G8T25zRSeprmuW\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=AEonO4l6HDM4HhdvW4MF\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=OK7fpunWWYJMgojgPQxt\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=zmUylf5CPV2xd4sCu83N\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=MkKORWI58t2Sn6Fl4Kt6\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=mqsCOTZwIGJweusnsGjd\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=ciHuRyw6mmGwxxSQVqOb\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=3kSBdCP2i0j3ER6w0bwy\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=8OldHBiAesIFQ9w3Bogr\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=A4RupGDSAwfx14N27B0Y\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=SagRWY1DjMwWVsp8OZhd\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=EqUTr0DL4UPl7DKCxCvA\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=F0iVyxvs2xecTROmBHZ5\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=mF9EemE4BZZeQJUMtwds\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=DEqySRoLHvPRsEXBcUM2\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=75YQtOJx85GYjJZqFzvc\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>"",""<iframe width=\""500\"" height=\""500\"" src=\""https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=gymwPFl3SRQTJi4ISR8R\"" style=\""max-width: 100%\""></iframe>""]"
