# Coach Journey Validation Questions for POWLAX MVP

## Based on Stakeholder Sentiments & Daily Journey Analysis

### 1. üéØ **Does the Strategy-Drill Connection Actually Solve the "Practice Planning Mess"?**

**Context from Sentiments**: Coaches struggle with "kids that don't show up... have terrible attitudes and literally do not try" and feel practice is a "mess."

**Journey Touchpoint**: Monday 11:30 AM - Coach Sarah sees drills WITH strategy tags

**Validation Question**: 
- When Coach Sarah filters by "2-3-1 Motion Offense" and sees 3 specific drills, does this give her the confidence that practice will have PURPOSE?
- Does seeing "Triangle Passing [2-3-1 Motion]" make her think "Finally, the kids will understand WHY we're doing this drill"?

**Success Metric**: Coach should feel relief that drills aren't random anymore - they connect to game strategy.

### 2. üì± **Will the 15-Minute Practice Planning Actually Happen?**

**Context from Sentiments**: Coaches feel overwhelmed juggling "player development, parent expectations, and team management challenges."

**Journey Touchpoint**: Monday planning session reduced from 45 mins to 15 mins

**Validation Question**:
- Can a stressed volunteer parent-coach REALLY create a meaningful practice in 15 minutes during lunch break?
- What if they get interrupted or only have 5 minutes?
- Does the smart filter + drag-and-drop feel intuitive enough for first-time app users?

**Success Metric**: Even a tech-challenged coach can build a practice plan in under 20 minutes on first try.

### 3. ü§ù **How Does This Help With the Parent Problem?**

**Context from Sentiments**: "I welcome any parent who wants to donate 30+ hrs a week" and dealing with parents who think "coach is crapping on my kid."

**Journey Touchpoint**: Wednesday 3:00 PM - Sharing Emma's skill plan with her mom

**Validation Question**:
- When Coach shares the skill plan link, does the parent SEE the structured approach and feel their concern was heard?
- Does showing "Pick Basics [2-3-1 Motion]" help the parent understand it's not favoritism but skill development?
- Can this feature reduce those tense "why isn't my kid playing?" conversations?

**Success Metric**: Parents comment "I love that I can see exactly what my child needs to work on" instead of complaining about playing time.

### 4. üí™ **Does Daily Use Build Coaching Confidence or Add Stress?**

**Context from Sentiments**: Coaches are torn between "instilling discipline and keeping the game fun" and worry about kids who "don't listen unless they want to."

**Journey Touchpoint**: Multiple daily touchpoints - pre-practice check, during practice, post-practice notes

**Validation Question**:
- After 2 weeks, does Coach Sarah feel MORE confident or MORE dependent on the app?
- When she shows the drill video to her assistant (Tuesday 4:00 PM), does it make her look prepared or reliant on technology?
- Do the strategy connections help her answer player questions with authority?

**Success Metric**: Coaches report feeling like "real coaches" not just "drill runners" after 30 days.

### 5. üéâ **Will This Create the "Love the Game" Moments Coaches Dream Of?**

**Context from Sentiments**: Coaches want "kids who love to be there and are eager to learn" where "no one is standing still out of boredom."

**Journey Touchpoint**: The "Aha moment" - Tuesday 4:15 PM when players understand WHY they do drills

**Validation Question**:
- When Coach explains "This drill teaches the exact movement for our 2-3-1 offense," do players actually engage more?
- Does this create the "laughing, learning new drills" atmosphere coaches crave?
- After a month, are more kids showing up to practice consistently?

**Success Metric**: 
- Player attendance improves by 20%
- Coaches report "kids are asking about strategies" 
- Parents say "my child actually wants to go to practice now"

## üîç Bonus Meta-Question: Does This Scale Beyond Tech-Savvy Coaches?

**Critical Consideration**: The journey shows a coach comfortable with screenshots, app navigation, and sharing links. But from sentiments, many youth coaches are volunteer parents who might struggle with technology.

**Key Question**: How does POWLAX ensure that the overwhelmed volunteer parent-coach who "welcomes any parent who wants to donate 30+ hrs" can achieve these same victories without feeling more overwhelmed by learning new technology?

**Success Metric**: 80% of first-time volunteer coaches successfully create and run their first practice plan without external help.
