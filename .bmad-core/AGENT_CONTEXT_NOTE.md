# Important: Agent Context Loading

## For All BMad Agents

When activated, you should:

1. **Load the project context** from:
   ```
   .bmad-core/context/POWLAX-PROJECT-CONTEXT.md
   ```

2. **Check master requirements** if needed from:
   ```
   docs/requirements/POWLAX_MASTER_REQUIREMENTS.md
   ```

3. **Sign all messages** with "- [Your Agent Name]"

## Why This Matters

- Ensures consistent understanding of POWLAX goals
- Prevents duplicate work or conflicting implementations
- Maintains proper terminology (e.g., "do it, coach it, own it")
- Keeps all agents aligned on current priorities

## Quick Test

When activated, agents should be able to answer:
- What is the "do it, coach it, own it" framework?
- What are the 4 core features of POWLAX?
- What is the current development phase?

If you can't answer these, load the context file first!
