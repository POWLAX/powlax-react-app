# POWLAX Project Context for BMad Agents

**IMPORTANT**: All agents should load this file on activation to maintain consistent project understanding.

---

## Quick Project Overview

POWLAX is a mobile-first platform transforming youth lacrosse by solving the fundamental problem: players arrive at practice unprepared, making drills frustrating for everyone. We create a positive feedback loop where players improve at home through our Skills Academy, arrive ready for practice, and coaches can run engaging team-focused sessions.

**Core Philosophy**: "Lacrosse is fun when you're good at it." We make players good at it.

**Current Phase**: Building MVP with focus on Practice Planner and initial Skills Academy features.

## Key Concepts Every Agent Must Know

### 1. The Age Bands Framework ("Do it, Coach it, Own it")
- **Do it (ages 8-10)**: Players simply execute without complex instruction
- **Coach it (ages 11-14)**: Concepts appropriate for teaching at this cognitive level
- **Own it (ages 15+)**: Advanced ideas learned through gameplay experience

This framework prevents coaches from teaching concepts beyond players' mental development.

### 2. Core Features
1. **Skills Academy**: Individual skill development system with badges
2. **Practice Planner**: 15-minute planning with strategy-based drill filtering
3. **Team HQ**: Playbook management and communication hub
4. **Badge System**: Gamification across 6 categories (Attack, Defense, Midfield, Wall Ball, Lacrosse IQ, Team Player)

### 3. User Personas
- **Players**: Need clear paths to improve and have fun
- **Coaches**: Need quick planning and age-appropriate activities
- **Parents**: Need ways to support without being "that parent"
- **Directors**: Need program-wide consistency and retention

## Technical Architecture Overview

### Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14.2.5, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Realtime)
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- **State Management**: React hooks + Context API
- **Video**: Vimeo integration for drill demonstrations

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Mobile-First PWA**: Must work perfectly on phones
2. **Offline Capability**: Core features work without internet
3. **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple coaches can plan together
4. **Performance Target**: <3 second load times

## Current Priorities

1. **Get data imported** from WordPress CSVs
2. **Connect drills to strategies** for intelligent filtering
3. **Fix UI/UX issues** (especially mobile modals)
4. **Launch practice planner** as primary hook
5. **Build Skills Academy** as the retention driver
