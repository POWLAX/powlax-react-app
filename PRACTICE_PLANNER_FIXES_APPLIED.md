# ‚úÖ Practice Planner Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Build Error - Duplicate Declaration ‚úÖ
**Problem:** `showEditModal` was declared twice in StrategiesTab.tsx
**Solution:** Removed duplicate declaration on line 73

### 2. Invalid UUID Error ‚úÖ 
**Problem:** URL `/teams/1/practice-plans` uses "1" which is not a valid UUID
**Solution:** Added UUID validation in page.tsx - now handles non-UUID team IDs gracefully

### 3. Authentication & Save Issues üîß
**Root Cause:** No users in auth.users table, only in public.users
**Migration Needed:** Run Migration 112 to fix foreign key constraints

## Quick Access URLs:

### Working URLs (use one of these):
- `http://localhost:3000/teams/practice-plans` (no team ID - loads all practices)
- `http://localhost:3000/teams/d6b72e87-8fab-4f4c-9921-260501605ee2/practice-plans` (valid UUID)

### Broken URL (don't use):
- ‚ùå `http://localhost:3000/teams/1/practice-plans` (now handled gracefully)

## Database Fix Still Needed:

Run this migration in Supabase Dashboard to fix save/load:

```sql
-- Migration 112: Fix foreign key constraints
ALTER TABLE practices 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS practices_created_by_fkey;

ALTER TABLE practices
ADD CONSTRAINT practices_created_by_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (created_by) 
REFERENCES public.users(id) 
ON DELETE SET NULL;

ALTER TABLE practices
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS practices_coach_id_fkey;

ALTER TABLE practices
ADD CONSTRAINT practices_coach_id_fkey
FOREIGN KEY (coach_id)
REFERENCES public.users(id)
ON DELETE SET NULL;

-- Update RLS policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can manage their own practices" ON practices;

CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own practices" ON practices
    FOR ALL 
    TO authenticated 
    USING (
      created_by IN (
        SELECT id FROM public.users 
        WHERE auth_user_id = auth.uid()
      )
    )
    WITH CHECK (
      created_by IN (
        SELECT id FROM public.users 
        WHERE auth_user_id = auth.uid()
      )
    );
```

## Testing Status:
- ‚úÖ Build compiles successfully
- ‚úÖ Page loads without errors
- ‚úÖ Invalid team IDs handled gracefully
- üîß Save/Load needs migration to work

## Next Steps:
1. Run Migration 112 in Supabase Dashboard
2. Test with chaplalalacrosse22@gmail.com account
3. Verify save/load functionality works
