-- Migration: 124_fix_users_rls_infinite_recursion.sql
-- Date: 2025-01-12
-- Author: Claude
-- =====================================================

-- ### WHAT WE'RE FIXING ###
-- 
-- PROBLEM: RLS infinite recursion on users table preventing all access
-- Error: "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation 'users'"
-- 
-- ROOT CAUSE: 
-- The RLS policies on the users table contain subqueries that reference 
-- the users table itself, creating an infinite loop when PostgreSQL 
-- tries to evaluate the policies.
--
-- IMPACT:
-- - Teams page shows "No Teams Yet" even though data exists
-- - Any authenticated/anon user cannot access users table
-- - Team member lookups fail with recursion error
-- - Only service_role can access the table
--
-- VERIFIED DATABASE STATE (via service role analysis):
-- ✅ 14 users exist (including patrick@powlax.com)
-- ✅ 3 clubs exist (including Your Club OS)  
-- ✅ 14 teams exist (3 belong to Your Club OS)
-- ✅ 26 team_members records exist
-- ✅ Patrick (ID: 523f2768-6404-439c-a429-f9eb6736aa17) is already:
--    - Member of Your Club OS
--    - head_coach of Your Varsity Team HQ
--    - assistant_coach of Your JV Team HQ
--    - player of Your 8th Grade Team HQ
--
-- SOLUTION:
-- 1. Remove ALL existing policies on users table (to eliminate recursion)
-- 2. Create simple, non-recursive policies that don't self-reference
-- 3. Fix related table policies (clubs, teams, team_members)
-- 4. Preserve all existing data (no data changes)

-- STEP 1: FIX THE USERS TABLE RLS INFINITE RECURSION

-- We must be thorough to ensure no recursive policies remain
