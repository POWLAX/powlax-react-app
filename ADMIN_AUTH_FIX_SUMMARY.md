# Admin Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
When logging in as an administrator, users were being redirected to the dashboard and couldn't access admin pages. The investigation revealed several issues:

### 1. Role Mismatch
- **Database roles**: `admin`, `director`, `coach`
- **Code expected**: `administrator`, `club_director`, `team_coach`
- The mismatch prevented proper role detection

### 2. Missing Navigation
- Admin pages existed but weren't visible in the sidebar navigation
- No way to access `/admin/*` routes even for administrators

### 3. Auth Context Not Mapping Roles
- The SupabaseAuthContext was passing database roles directly without translation
- Admin pages checked for "administrator" but users had "admin"

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. SupabaseAuthContext Role Mapping
Added role mapping function to translate database roles to expected format:
```typescript
const mapRoles = (roles: string[]): string[] => {
  const roleMap: Record<string, string> = {
    'admin': 'administrator',
    'director': 'club_director',
    'coach': 'team_coach',
    'player': 'player',
    'parent': 'parent'
  }
  return roles.map(role => roleMap[role] || role)
}
```

### 2. Updated Direct Login
Modified `/direct-login` to use actual database user data with correct role mapping.

### 3. Added Admin Navigation
Added admin section to sidebar navigation that shows only for administrators:
- Role Management (`/admin/role-management`)
- Drill Editor (`/admin/drill-editor`)
- WP Import Check (`/admin/wp-import-check`)
- Sync Data (`/admin/sync`)

## How It Works Now

1. **User logs in** with email/password or direct login
2. **SupabaseAuthContext** fetches user from database
3. **Roles are mapped** from database format to expected format:
   - `admin` → `administrator`
   - `director` → `club_director`
   - `coach` → `team_coach`
4. **Navigation checks** for `administrator` role and shows admin section
5. **Admin pages** check for `administrator` or `club_director` roles

## Testing Instructions

### Option 1: Direct Login (Quick Test)
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/direct-login
2. Click "Login as patrick@powlax.com"
3. You should see:
   - Admin section in sidebar with 4 admin pages
   - Able to access all admin pages without errors

### Option 2: Regular Login
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/auth/login
2. Login with admin credentials
3. Admin navigation should appear based on your roles

## Verification
patrick@powlax.com now has:
- Database roles: `["director", "admin", "coach"]`
- Mapped roles: `["club_director", "administrator", "team_coach"]`
- Can access: All admin pages ✅
- Can manage: User roles ✅

## Files Modified
1. `/src/contexts/SupabaseAuthContext.tsx` - Added role mapping
2. `/src/app/direct-login/page.tsx` - Updated mock user data
3. `/src/components/navigation/SidebarNavigation.tsx` - Added admin navigation items

## Future Considerations
1. Consider updating database to use consistent role names
2. Add middleware for route protection (currently only UI-based)
3. Implement proper Supabase Auth integration instead of custom auth
