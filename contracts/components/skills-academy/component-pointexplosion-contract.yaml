# Animation Performance Analysis
animationPerformance:
  performanceConsiderations:
    - "Framer Motion creates complex DOM animations"
    - "Multiple particles can impact mobile performance"
    - "Image loading for point type icons during animation"
    
  optimizationOpportunities:
    - "Particle count limits based on device capabilities"
    - "Canvas-based rendering instead of DOM elements"
    - "Preloaded point type icons"
    - "Animation frame limiting for performance"
    
  technicalDebt:
    - "Heavy dependency on framer-motion"
    - "No fallback for devices with poor performance"
    - "Complex state management for particle tracking"

# Gamification Context
