I need you to execute the GamiPress Migration Contract located at `/contracts/GAMIPRESS-MIGRATION-CONTRACT.md`.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **Begin with ULTRA THINK phase** (minimum 5 minutes) to analyze all dependencies and risks
2. Use **5 parallel general-purpose agents** as specified in the contract
3. Migrate **59 point types**, **52 badges**, and **2 rank types** from WordPress GamiPress to Supabase
4. Source data is in `/docs/Wordpress CSV's/Gamipress Gamification Exports/`
5. Follow the exact agent boundaries to avoid file conflicts

**Contract Details:**
- Contract ID: POWLAX-GAM-001
- Execution Strategy: PARALLEL with Ultra Think
- Estimated Time: 4 hours
- Risk Level: LOW (additive only)

**Key Context:**
- 10 WordPress users have been migrated with `wordpress_id` field
- Supabase gamification tables exist but are empty
- Icons need to be downloaded from WordPress and uploaded to Supabase Storage
- WordPress remains source of truth during transition

**Validation Required:**
- All 59 point types with icons
- All 52 badges with requirements
- User point balances preserved
- Sync system operational

Please begin with the Ultra Think phase, then deploy the 5 parallel agents according to the contract specifications.

## Expected Outcome

By completion, the POWLAX app will have:

2. All user achievements preserved
3. Icon assets properly displayed
4. Bi-directional sync established
5. Zero data loss from migration
