# üö® AGENT SYSTEM MIGRATION - MASTER CONTROLLER DEPRECATED

**Date:** January 14, 2025  
**Status:** MIGRATION COMPLETE  
**Action Required:** Use ONLY general-purpose sub-agents

---

## üìã CRITICAL CHANGE: NO MORE MASTER CONTROLLER SYSTEM

### ‚ùå DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE
- **powlax-master-controller** - Legacy master controller system
- **powlax-frontend-developer** - Specialized frontend agent
- **powlax-backend-architect** - Specialized backend agent  
- **powlax-test-specialist** - Specialized testing agent
- **BMad workflow** - Legacy brainstorming system
- **Complex orchestration** - Multi-agent coordination systems

### ‚úÖ NEW APPROACH - GENERAL-PURPOSE SUB-AGENTS ONLY

#### Correct Usage Pattern
```javascript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Simple, focused general-purpose agent
Task({
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  description: "Implement authentication modal component",
  prompt: "Create a simple login modal following the project patterns..."
})
```

#### Incorrect Usage Patterns  
```javascript
// ‚ùå WRONG - Never use these
powlax-master-controller
powlax-frontend-developer  
powlax-backend-architect
BMad brainstorming workflow
Complex multi-agent orchestration
```

## üîß WHAT WAS UPDATED

### Core Documentation Files
- **‚úÖ CLAUDE.md** - Updated to emphasize general-purpose agents only
- **‚úÖ contracts/active/PRACTICE_PLANNER_DEVELOPMENT_CONTRACT.md** - Removed master controller references
- **‚úÖ src/components/practice-planner/PLANNER_MASTER_CONTRACT.md** - Updated to forbid specialized controllers
- **‚úÖ contracts/CONTRACT_VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md** - Changed from master controller to general-purpose verification
- **‚úÖ contracts/CONTRACT_APPROVAL_TRACKER.md** - Updated approval process for general-purpose agents
- **‚úÖ config/yolo-mode.config.yaml** - Added warnings against specialized controllers

### Key Changes Made
1. **Removed BMad references** - No more complex brainstorming workflow
2. **Deprecated specialized controllers** - All powlax-* specialized agents forbidden
3. **Emphasized simplicity** - Single-purpose, focused contracts only
4. **Updated verification process** - General-purpose agents handle their own verification

---

## üéØ NEW DEVELOPMENT APPROACH

### ‚úÖ Recommended Pattern
1. **Simple Tasks** - One focused objective per agent
2. **Clear Contracts** - Specific requirements and deliverables
3. **General-Purpose Agents** - No specialized roles or complex orchestration
4. **Direct Implementation** - Agents implement directly without coordination layers

### ‚úÖ Example Good Deployment
```javascript
Task({
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  description: "Fix dashboard loading issue",
  prompt: `
    Problem: Dashboard shows infinite loading spinner
    Fix: Remove auth blocking in useDashboardData hook
    Test: Verify dashboard loads immediately
    Files: src/hooks/useDashboardData.ts
  `
})
```

### ‚ùå Example Bad Deployment (Don't Do This)
```javascript
// DON'T DO THIS - Complex orchestration
powlax-master-controller.deploy([
  "powlax-frontend-developer", 
  "powlax-backend-architect"
]).with(BMad.brainstorm("dashboard improvement"))
```

## üìä MIGRATION STATUS

### ‚úÖ Files Updated (6 files)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Core project documentation
- `contracts/active/PRACTICE_PLANNER_DEVELOPMENT_CONTRACT.md` - Active development contract
- `src/components/practice-planner/PLANNER_MASTER_CONTRACT.md` - Practice planner contract
- `contracts/CONTRACT_VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md` - Verification process
- `contracts/CONTRACT_APPROVAL_TRACKER.md` - Approval tracking
- `config/yolo-mode.config.yaml` - Configuration warnings

### üìÅ Legacy Files (Preserved in Backups)
- All `contracts_backup_20250813_2354/` files contain old references (archived)
- All `components_backup_20250813_2357/` files contain old references (archived)  
- Various docs/ files contain historical references (preserved for reference)

---

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### For All Future Development
1. **‚úÖ Use ONLY** `Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", ...)`
2. **‚ùå Never use** specialized controllers or complex orchestration
3. **‚úÖ Keep tasks simple** and focused on single objectives
4. **‚úÖ Write clear contracts** with specific deliverables

### For Existing Contracts
- All active contracts have been updated to reflect the new approach
- Legacy contracts in backup folders are preserved but should not be followed
- New contracts should follow the general-purpose pattern only

---

## üéØ WHY THIS CHANGE WAS MADE

### Problems with Master Controller System
- **Complexity** - Too many moving parts and coordination overhead
- **Implementation errors** - Complex workflows caused more bugs
- **Confusion** - Multiple agent types created unclear responsibilities  
- **Inefficiency** - Orchestration layers slowed down development

### Benefits of General-Purpose Approach
- **Simplicity** - Single agent type, clear responsibilities
- **Reliability** - Fewer failure points, more predictable outcomes
- **Speed** - Direct implementation without coordination overhead
- **Clarity** - Obvious what each agent should do

---

## üìã VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

### ‚úÖ Migration Complete When:
- [x] All active contracts updated to forbid specialized controllers
- [x] All documentation emphasizes general-purpose agents only  
- [x] Configuration files warn against specialized controllers
- [x] Examples show correct general-purpose usage patterns
- [x] Legacy references clearly marked as deprecated

### üö® Red Flags to Watch For:
- Any mention of "powlax-master-controller" in new contracts
- References to "BMad workflow" or complex orchestration
- Specialized agent types (frontend-developer, backend-architect, etc.)
- Multi-agent coordination or orchestration patterns

---

## üéâ MIGRATION SUCCESS

**‚úÖ MASTER CONTROLLER SYSTEM SUCCESSFULLY DEPRECATED**

All documentation and contracts now correctly emphasize using general-purpose sub-agents only. The complex master controller and specialized agent system has been replaced with a simple, focused approach that reduces errors and improves development speed.

**Going forward: Use ONLY general-purpose sub-agents with focused, single-objective contracts.**
