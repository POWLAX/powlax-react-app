# Error Handling Strategy
errorHandlingStrategy:
  errorCapture:
    - "JavaScript errors in workout components"
    - "Component lifecycle errors"
    - "Render errors and infinite loops"
    
  errorRecovery:
    - "Graceful fallback UI instead of white screen"
    - "User-friendly error messages"
    - "Retry mechanism to reset error state"
    - "Navigation escape hatch to return to safe state"
    
  userExperience:
    - "Maintains app stability during errors"
    - "Provides clear recovery path"
    - "Prevents complete app crashes"
    - "Preserves user confidence in app reliability"

# Production Readiness
productionReadiness:
  robustness:
    - "Implements React error boundary best practices"
    - "Provides multiple recovery options"
    - "Handles both development and production scenarios"
    
  monitoring:
    - "Console logging for development debugging"
    - "Error and errorInfo capture for analysis"
    - "Component stack trace preservation"
    
  enhancementOpportunities:
    - "Integration with error monitoring services (Sentry, etc.)"
    - "Database error logging for admin analysis"
    - "User feedback collection on errors"
    - "Automatic error reporting to development team"

# Critical MVP Component
mvpCriticalAssessment:
  importance: "Essential for production stability"
  riskMitigation: "Prevents workout crashes from breaking entire user experience"
  userTrust: "Maintains user confidence by handling errors gracefully"
  
  implementationRequirements:
    - "Wrap all major workout components"
    - "Provide clear recovery messaging"
    - "Ensure retry functionality works correctly"
    - "Test error scenarios thoroughly"

# Integration Points
integrationPoints:
  currentUsage:
    - "Should wrap WorkoutPlayer components"
    - "Should wrap complex drill sequence components" 
    - "Should wrap animation-heavy components"
    
  dataIntegrationPotential:
    - "Could log errors to admin dashboard"
    - "Could track error frequency by component"
    - "Could integrate with user feedback system"
    
  technicalConsiderations:
    - "Class component pattern (required for error boundaries)"
    - "Error state management and cleanup"
    - "Navigation handling during error recovery"
