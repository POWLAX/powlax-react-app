functionalAnalysis:
  purpose: "Visual timeline interface for organizing practice drills with support for parallel activities and time management. Core component for practice plan structure."
  primaryFunction: "Practice timeline management with drag-and-drop drill organization"
  userInteractions: 
    - "View practice timeline with calculated start times"
    - "Move drills up/down in timeline with arrow buttons"
    - "Edit drill duration inline by clicking duration badge"
    - "Remove individual drills from timeline"
    - "Add parallel activities to time slots"
    - "Edit parallel activity duration (affects all parallel drills)"
    - "View and edit setup time with notes"
    - "Visual duration progress bar integration"
  businessLogic: "Manages time slots containing single or multiple parallel drills, calculates cumulative start times, handles parallel drill duration synchronization, supports setup time calculations"
  stateManagement: "Local state for parallel drill picker, setup modal, duration editing, time calculations based on props from parent"
