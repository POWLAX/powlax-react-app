# Usage Analysis
usagePatterns:
  dataLoading: "Placeholder for any content being fetched from Supabase"
  dashboards: "Widget loading states while data loads"
  lists: "Team rosters, resource lists, drill libraries"
  cards: "Practice cards, user cards while content loads"
  mobileFriendly: true
  
loadingScenarios:
  - "Initial page load data fetching"
  - "User interaction triggered data loading"
  - "Background data refresh"
  - "Progressive data loading"
  
animation:
  - "CSS pulse animation for breathing effect"
  - "Smooth, non-distracting movement"
  - "Accessible for users with motion sensitivity"
  - "Consistent timing with other UI animations"
  
sizePatterns:
  textSkeleton: "h-4 w-[250px] - for text content placeholders"
  cardSkeleton: "h-32 w-full - for card-shaped content"
  avatarSkeleton: "h-10 w-10 rounded-full - for circular profile images"
  buttonSkeleton: "h-9 w-20 - for button placeholders"
  
integrationOpportunity: "Essential for all Supabase data loading states"
criticalForUX: "Prevents layout shift and provides feedback during data fetching"
bestPractices:
  - "Match the approximate size of final content"
  - "Use multiple skeletons for complex layouts"
  - "Replace with actual content smoothly"
  - "Provide consistent loading experience"
