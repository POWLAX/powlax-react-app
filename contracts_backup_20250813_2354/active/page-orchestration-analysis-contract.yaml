# ===== CONTRACT OVERVIEW =====
intent:
  goal: "Analyze all POWLAX page files to understand page-level orchestration, server-side data fetching, component composition, and routing patterns"
  
  scope:
    - Analyze all page.tsx files in src/app/
    - Document server vs client components
    - Map page-level data fetching strategies
    - Identify component composition patterns
    - Document route guards and middleware
    - Analyze layout files and their impact
    - Map page-to-page navigation flows
    - Identify page-specific business logic
    
  outOfScope:
    - Component internals (already analyzed)
    - Database schema (already documented)
    - Component-level hooks (already mapped)
    
  rationale: "Complete the final 5% of system understanding by analyzing how pages orchestrate components, fetch data at the page level, and manage routing/navigation flows"

# ===== ANALYSIS GUIDELINES =====
analysisGuidelines:
  serverVsClient:
    identifyingServerComponents:
      - No 'use client' directive
      - Async components
      - Direct database queries
      - Server-only imports
      
    identifyingClientComponents:
      - 'use client' directive
      - Uses hooks (useState, useEffect)
      - Event handlers
      - Browser APIs
      
  dataFetchingPatterns:
    serverSide:
      - Direct Supabase queries in component
      - fetch() in Server Components
      - generateStaticParams
      - generateMetadata
      
    clientSide:
      - useEffect data fetching
      - SWR or React Query
      - Custom hooks
      - Event-triggered fetches
      
  criticalAnalysisPoints:
    - How initial page data is loaded
    - Where authentication is verified
    - How components receive data
    - When realtime subscriptions start
    - How errors are handled
    - Where navigation decisions are made
