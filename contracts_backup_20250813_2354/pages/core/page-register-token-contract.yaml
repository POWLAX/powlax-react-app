  processingSteps:
    1. "Page loads with token parameter"
    2. "User fills registration form"
    3. "Form submission triggers API call"
    4. "Server validates token and creates user"
    5. "Success/error feedback displayed"
  stateManagement:
    - "loading": "Initial page load"
    - "ready": "Form ready for input"
    - "done": "Registration completed"
    - "error": "Registration failed"

analysisNotes:
  - "Simple registration flow with token-based security"
  - "Minimal form - only email and full name required"
  - "Uses API route for server-side token processing"
  - "Good state management for user feedback"
  - "Self-contained registration process"
