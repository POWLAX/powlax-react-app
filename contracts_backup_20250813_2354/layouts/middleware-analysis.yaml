securityGaps:
  pageProtection:
    issue: "No Next.js middleware.ts for page protection"

      ```typescript
      import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
      import { createMiddlewareClient } from '@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs'
      
      export async function middleware(req: NextRequest) {
        const res = NextResponse.next()
        const supabase = createMiddlewareClient({ req, res })
        
        // Check authentication for protected routes
        const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession()
        
        // Protected route patterns
        if (req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard') ||
            req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/teams') ||
            req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/admin')) {
          
          if (!session) {
            return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/auth/login', req.url))
          }
