- Acts as living handoff between Claude and sub-agents

### **2. Development Workflow**
```
1. PLAN ‚Üí Create detailed implementation plan in this document
2. VERIFY ‚Üí Use Ultra Think to validate the plan
3. EXECUTE ‚Üí YOLO mode with focused sub-agents
4. TEST ‚Üí Playwright testing before marking complete
5. UPDATE ‚Üí Log changes, errors, and migrations here
```

### **3. Sub-Agent Requirements**
- Test with Playwright BEFORE reporting back
- Update this document with results
- Verify Supabase tables before implementation
- ONE focused task per agent
- Keep dev server running (Patrick needs it for testing)

### **4. Migration Logging**
```sql
-- Format: ###_issue_we_are_fixing.sql
-- Example: 085_gamification_point_persistence.sql
-- Location: supabase/migrations/
```

### **‚ùå CRITICAL GAPS (MVP BLOCKERS)**
1. **Gamification System** - NO PERSISTENCE
   - Points calculated but not saved
   - No API endpoints exist
   - user_points_wallets not connected
   - No streak tracking

2. **Timer Enforcement** - NOT IMPLEMENTED
   - Need (duration_minutes - 1) timer before "Did It"
   - Track individual drill times
   - Show itemized breakdown at end

3. **Authentication** - USING TEST_USER_ID
   - Must use patrick@powlax.com
   - Remove hardcoded test user

4. **Track System** - NOT IMPLEMENTED
   - ELITE TRACK (3 months, series ascending)
   - EXPERIENCE TRACK (1 month, progression)
   - Modal selection per container

### **üìù PATRICK'S PRIORITY NOTES**
- **10/10 MUST DO**: Gamification, Point Persistence, Timer Enforcement
- **8/10 High Priority**: Track System, Drill Time Tracking
- **5/10 Medium**: Multipliers, Streak Bonuses
- **NOT FOR MVP**: Coach Assignments, Team Competitions, Progress Page

---

## üéØ **TRACK SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS**

### **ELITE TRACK (3 Months)**
- 3 workouts/week based on series_type
- Ascending within series by series_code
- Week 2 of `attack` ‚Üí Only A2 series workouts shown
- Completing faster allowed, but only track workouts count

### **EXPERIENCE TRACK (1 Month)**  
- 3 workouts/week across series progression
- Week 2 of `attack` ‚Üí A4, A5, A6 available (any order)
- Progressive difficulty increase

### **Implementation:**
- "Begin ELITE Track" / "Begin EXPERIENCE Track" buttons per container
- Modal with track details and confirmation
- Max 2 tracks active (1 per series)
- Non-track workouts still available (less points)

---

## üîß **TIMER ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM**

### **Requirements:**
```javascript
// Each drill must enforce minimum time
const minTimeSeconds = (drill.duration_minutes - 1) * 60;
const [timeElapsed, setTimeElapsed] = useState(0);
const canMarkComplete = timeElapsed >= minTimeSeconds;

// Track individual drill times
drillTimes: {
  [drillId]: {
    started: timestamp,
    completed: timestamp,
    duration: seconds
  }
}

// Show breakdown at completion
"Drill 1: Wall Ball Basics - 2:45"
"Drill 2: Quick Stick - 3:12"
"Total Workout Time: 15:32"
```

---

## üêõ **COMMON ERRORS LOG**

### **Error 1: Points Not Persisting**
**Cause**: API endpoint `/api/workouts/progress` doesn't exist  
**Fix**: Create API route with Supabase integration
**File**: `src/app/api/workouts/progress/route.ts`

### **Error 2: TEST_USER_ID Hardcoded**
**Cause**: Line 84 in workout/[id]/page.tsx  
**Fix**: Use authenticated user from context
**Note**: Test with patrick@powlax.com

### **Error 3: Drills Clickable in Navigation**
**Cause**: onClick handlers on drill navigation buttons  
**Fix**: Remove onClick for completed drills, sequential only
