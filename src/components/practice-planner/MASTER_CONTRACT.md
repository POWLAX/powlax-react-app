## ‚ö†Ô∏è **MANDATORY AGENT INSTRUCTIONS**

### **üî¥ CRITICAL: READ BEFORE ANY CHANGES**
1. **NO FEATURE REMOVAL** - Everything in MVP must be enhanced, not stripped
2. **DIRECT NEGOTIATION REQUIRED** - Propose specific changes, get user approval
3. **TEAM_DRILLS TABLE FOCUS** - Primary data source for all drill operations
4. **MOBILE-FIRST APPROACH** - All changes must work perfectly on mobile devices

### **üìã CONTRACT NEGOTIATION PROCESS**
1. **ANALYZE** current state of ALL components thoroughly
2. **PROPOSE** specific enhancement plan for each feature  
3. **NEGOTIATE** with user until contract is exactly what they want
4. **IMPLEMENT** only user-approved changes
5. **SUB-AGENT COORDINATION** - Control multiple specialized agents for complex tasks
6. **TESTING VALIDATION** - All sub-agents must test with Playwright before reporting
7. **MANDATORY CHECKOUT** - Get explicit user approval before exiting Claude

## üóÑÔ∏è **DATA INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS**

### **Primary Data Source: `team_drills` Table**
```sql
-- Expected schema (verify before implementing)
team_drills {
  id, name, duration, category, 
  video_url, drill_lab_url_1-5,
  strategies[], concepts[], skills[],
  coach_instructions, notes, equipment[]
}
```

### **Secondary Data Sources**
- **`strategies`** - Strategy-drill relationships
- **`practice_plans`** - Saved practice sessions (already working)
- **`user_favorites`** - Persistent favorites system
- **`teams`** - Team-specific drill access

### **Current Problems to Fix**
- ‚ùå `useDrills` hook falls back to mock data
- ‚ùå Video URLs not connected to real videos
- ‚ùå Strategy connections are hardcoded
- ‚ùå Lacrosse Lab URLs are broken/outdated
- ‚ùå Print button does nothing
- ‚ùå Refresh button does nothing
- ‚ùå Favorites don't persist

## üìû **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

### **Master Agent Deployment Command:**
```
"Deploy Master Practice Planner Enhancement Agent with full component analysis and contract negotiation"
```

### **Agent Success Metrics:**

## üîí **MANDATORY USER CHECKOUT PROTOCOL**

### **üö® CRITICAL: NO EXIT WITHOUT APPROVAL**
The Master Agent **CANNOT EXIT CLAUDE** until the user explicitly approves completion.

### **Checkout Process Requirements:**
```markdown
## üìã CONTRACT COMPLETION CHECKLIST

### **Implementation Status**
- [ ] All negotiated features implemented
- [ ] All sub-agent tasks completed and tested
- [ ] Playwright tests passing for all changes
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified
- [ ] Database connections working
- [ ] Error handling implemented

### **User Approval Required**
- [ ] User has tested the implementation
- [ ] User approves all changes made
- [ ] User confirms contract requirements met
- [ ] User grants permission to exit

### **Final Actions**
- [ ] Update component documentation
- [ ] Log all changes made
- [ ] Provide deployment instructions
- [ ] Archive completed contract
```

### **Exit Protocol:**
1. **Present Completion Summary** - Show all work completed
2. **Request User Testing** - Ask user to verify implementation
3. **Discuss Any Issues** - Address user concerns or modifications
4. **Get Explicit Approval** - "Do you approve contract completion and grant permission to exit?"
5. **Only Exit After "YES"** - Must receive explicit user approval

### **Multi-Agent Coordination Protocol:**
```markdown
## ü§ñ SUB-AGENT MANAGEMENT

### **Sub-Agent Deployment:**
- Master Agent identifies complex tasks requiring specialization
- Deploys focused sub-agents for specific components
- Provides each sub-agent with specific contract requirements
- Monitors sub-agent progress and quality

### **Sub-Agent Testing Requirements:**
- All sub-agents must write Playwright tests for their changes
- Tests must pass before reporting completion to Master Agent
- Mobile responsiveness tests required for UI changes
- Database integration tests for data-related changes

### **Sub-Agent Reporting:**
- Sub-agents report completion with test results
- Master Agent validates sub-agent work before integration
- Master Agent coordinates between multiple sub-agents
- Master Agent presents unified results to user
```
