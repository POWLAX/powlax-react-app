## ‚ö†Ô∏è **MANDATORY AGENT INSTRUCTIONS**

### **üî¥ CRITICAL: READ BEFORE ANY CHANGES**
1. **NO FEATURE REMOVAL** - Everything in MVP must be enhanced, not stripped
2. **DIRECT NEGOTIATION REQUIRED** - Propose specific changes, get user approval
3. **POWLAX_DRILLS TABLE FOCUS** - Primary data source for all drill operations
4. **MOBILE-FIRST APPROACH** - All changes must work perfectly on mobile devices

### **üìã CONTRACT NEGOTIATION PROCESS**
1. **ANALYZE** current state of ALL components thoroughly
2. **PROPOSE** specific enhancement plan for each feature  
3. **NEGOTIATE** with user until contract is exactly what they want
4. **IMPLEMENT** only user-approved changes
5. **SUB-AGENT COORDINATION** - Control multiple specialized agents for complex tasks
6. **TESTING VALIDATION** - All sub-agents must test with Playwright before reporting
7. **MANDATORY CHECKOUT** - Get explicit user approval before exiting Claude

## üéØ **MVP SCOPE: ALL FEATURES INCLUDED**

### **‚úÖ FEATURES TO ENHANCE (NOT REMOVE)**
```
‚úÖ Practice Timeline (drag-drop drills) - ENHANCE with better UX
‚úÖ Real Drill Library (from powlax_drills table) - CONNECT to database
‚úÖ Save/Load Practice Plans - ENHANCE with better UI
‚úÖ Mobile-First Design - OPTIMIZE for field usage
‚úÖ Print functionality - MAKE FUNCTIONAL (PDF generation)
‚úÖ Refresh button - MAKE FUNCTIONAL (data sync)
‚úÖ Complex filtering system - CONNECT to real data
‚úÖ Strategy modals - CONNECT to strategies table
‚úÖ Video modals - MAKE FUNCTIONAL with real videos
‚úÖ Lacrosse Lab modals - CONNECT to real lab URLs
‚úÖ Custom drill creation - SAVE to user_drills table
‚úÖ Custom strategy creation - SAVE to user_strategies table
‚úÖ Parallel drill system - ENHANCE functionality
‚úÖ Favorites system - PERSIST to database
‚úÖ All existing modal functionality - ENHANCE with real data
```

**KEY PRINCIPLE**: Nothing gets removed - everything gets connected to real data and made functional.

---

## üóÑÔ∏è **DATA INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS**

### **Primary Data Source: `powlax_drills` Table**
```sql
-- Expected schema (verify before implementing)
powlax_drills {
  id, name, duration, category, 
  video_url, drill_lab_url_1-5,
  strategies[], concepts[], skills[],
  coach_instructions, notes, equipment[]
}
```

### **Secondary Data Sources**
- **`powlax_strategies`** - listing a spot to select each strategy under each gamephase
- **`practice_plans`** - Saved practice sessions (already working)
- **`user_favorites`** - Persistent favorites system
- **`teams`** - Team-specific drill access

### **Current Problems to Fix**
- ‚ùå `useDrills` hook falls back to mock data
- ‚ùå Video URLs not connected to real videos
- ‚ùå Strategy connections are coded
- ‚ùå Lacrosse Lab URLs are broken/outdated - most likely the method of extracting from the json and putting into iframe - correct iframe output is - <iframe width="500" height="500" src="https://lacrosse.labradorsports.com/play?l=PP4bb1KQCS6MdOxWMe4B" style="max-width: 100%"></iframe> must remain square, but can be manipulated otherwise.
- ‚ùå Print button does nothing
- ‚ùå Refresh button does nothing
- ‚ùå Favorites don't persist

**Enhancement Requirements:**
- Save custom strategies to `user_strategies` table
- Full strategy property support
