# üéØ **PRACTICE PLANNER MASTER CONTRACT - HANDOFF DOCUMENT**

*Created: 2025-01-16 | Updated: 2025-01-11 | Status: LIVING DOCUMENT - IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT*  
*Component Directory: `src/components/practice-planner/`*  
*Main Page: `src/app/(authenticated)/teams/[teamId]/practiceplan/page.tsx`*

**‚ö†Ô∏è THIS IS THE OFFICIAL HANDOFF DOCUMENT FOR ALL PRACTICE PLANNER WORK**
**‚ö†Ô∏è MUST USE CLAUDE-TO-CLAUDE GENERAL-PURPOSE SUB-AGENTS ONLY**

## üö®üö®üö® CRITICAL WARNING - NEVER CREATE NEW PRACTICE PLANNER COMPONENTS üö®üö®üö®

### **INCIDENT: January 11, 2025 - PRACTICE PLANNER NEARLY DESTROYED**
**What Happened:** An AI assistant created a NEW simplified component called `PracticePlannerMain.tsx` instead of using the EXISTING practice planner. This replaced the full-featured practice planner with a basic, half-made version.

### **LESSONS LEARNED - MANDATORY READING:**
1. **NEVER create new practice planner components** - The practice planner already exists and is fully featured
2. **NEVER create `PracticePlannerMain.tsx`** - This was a mistake that almost destroyed the app
3. **The REAL practice planner is in:** `src/app/(authenticated)/teams/[teamId]/practiceplan/page.tsx`
4. **To add practice planner to multiple routes:** Use the SAME existing component, don't create new ones
5. **If you see a simplified practice planner:** STOP IMMEDIATELY - you're using the wrong component

### **CORRECT APPROACH FOR MULTIPLE ROUTES:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Import and use the existing practice planner
import TeamPracticePlanPage from '@/app/(authenticated)/teams/[teamId]/practiceplan/page'

// ‚ùå WRONG: Creating new components like PracticePlannerMain
```

### **FILES TO DELETE IF THEY EXIST:**
- `src/components/practice-planner/PracticePlannerMain.tsx` - DELETE THIS IF IT EXISTS
- Any other "simplified" or "main" practice planner components

### **THE REAL PRACTICE PLANNER HAS:**
- Full DrillLibraryTabbed with accordions
- StrategiesTab with all features
- Complex drill selection system
- Practice Timeline with parallel drills
- All modals (Study, Save, Load, etc.)
- Custom drill/strategy creation
- Favorites system
- Professional UI with all features

**If you don't see ALL these features, you're looking at the WRONG component!**

## üìç **PRACTICE PLANNER URL STRUCTURE - JANUARY 11, 2025**

### **Current Working URLs:**
1. **Team Practice Planner:** `/teams/[teamId]/practiceplan`
   - Full featured practice planner with team context
   - Original location, fully functional

2. **Standalone Practice Planner:** `/practiceplan` 
   - Redirects to `/teams/no-team/practiceplan`
   - For Coaching Kit members without Team HQ
   - Same full-featured practice planner

### **How It Works:**
- **One Component:** The REAL practice planner at `/teams/[teamId]/practiceplan/page.tsx`
- **Special Case:** When `teamId === 'no-team'`, component operates in standalone mode
- **Redirect:** `/practiceplan` ‚Üí `/teams/no-team/practiceplan`
- **Share to Team:** Shows "No team to share to! Consider getting Team HQ" message for non-team users

### **Navigation:**
- Sidebar has "Practice Planner" link that goes to `/practiceplan`
- Auto-redirects appropriately based on user context

---

## üóÑÔ∏è **DATA INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS**

### **Primary Data Source: `powlax_drills` Table**
```sql
-- CORRECTED SCHEMA (actual database columns)
powlax_drills {
  id, 
  title (NOT name),           -- Primary drill name field
  duration_minutes (NOT duration),  -- Duration in minutes
  category,                   -- Drill category
  video_url,                  -- Video URL field
  drill_lab_url_1 through drill_lab_url_5,  -- Individual lab URL fields
  game_states[],              -- Array of game phases
  tags,                       -- Drill tags
  content,                    -- Drill content/description
  coach_instructions,         -- Coaching notes
  notes,                      -- Additional notes
  equipment[]                 -- Required equipment
}
```

### **Secondary Data Sources**
- **`powlax_strategies`** - Strategy library with game phase categories
- **`practices`** - Saved practice sessions (NOT practice_plans)
- **`practice_drills`** - Drill instances with notes and modifications
- **`powlax_images`** - Drill media images
- **`user_drills`** - User-created custom drills (9/10 - MUST MATCH ALL COLUMNS OF powlax_drills structure.)
- **`user_strategies`** - User-created custom strategies - (9/10 - MUST MATCH ALL COLUMNS OF powlax_strategies structure.)
- **`teams`** - Team-specific drill access
- **`user_favorites`** - Persistent favorites (NEEDS CREATION)

### **Current Problems to Fix (By Priority)**
- üî¥ 10/10 Save/Load Practice Plans - NO PERSISTENCE OR DATA
- üî¥ 8/10 Custom drills don't save to user_drills table
- üî¥ 8/10 AddCustomStrategiesModal exists but doesn't save to database
- üü° 7/10 Favorites don't persist to database
- üü° 4/10 Strategy connections need real data from database
- üü° 2/10 Inconsistent field mapping (title vs name, duration_minutes vs duration)
- üü¢ EASY FIX: Restart button should clear timeline (not refresh data)
- ‚úÖ FIXED: DrillLibraryTabbed UserData type references replaced with proper Supabase User type
- ‚úÖ IGNORE: Print works fine (no PDF needed)
- ‚úÖ IGNORE: Video/Lab URLs (handled by Study Modal)

*‚úÖ FIXED UserData Type Issue: The authentication system was updated to use Supabase Auth directly, removing the custom UserData type. DrillLibraryTabbed.tsx and StrategiesTab.tsx now use the proper Supabase User type interface, eliminating TypeScript errors.

## ü§ñ **AGENT NEGOTIATION TEMPLATE**

### **Phase 1: Analysis & Proposal**
```markdown
## Component Analysis Report
- Current State: [Detailed analysis of each component]
- Data Connections: [What works vs. what's broken]
- Enhancement Priorities: [High/Medium/Low for each component]

## Proposed Enhancement Plan
- Database Schema Requirements: [Any table changes needed]
- Component Modifications: [Specific changes per component]
- New Functionality: [What gets added]
- Risk Assessment: [Potential breaking changes]

## Implementation Timeline
- Phase 1: [Core data connections]
- Phase 2: [Modal enhancements] 
- Phase 3: [Advanced features]
```

### **Phase 2: User Negotiation**
- Present specific proposals for each component
- Get explicit approval for each enhancement
- Adjust based on user feedback
- Finalize implementation contract

### **Phase 3: Implementation**
- Execute only user-approved changes
- Test each component thoroughly
- Provide progress updates
- Document all changes made

## üìû **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

### **MANDATORY Sub-Agent Deployment (ONLY APPROVED METHOD):**
```bash
# THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO IMPLEMENT CHANGES - NO EXCEPTIONS

# Example 1: Fix Save/Load (TOP PRIORITY)
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", 
     description="Fix Save/Load persistence",
     prompt="Read PLANNER_MASTER_CONTRACT.md and fix Save/Load Practice Plans persistence to practices table...")

# Example 2: Custom Drill Creation
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", 
     description="Fix custom drill saving",
     prompt="Read PLANNER_MASTER_CONTRACT.md and connect AddCustomDrillModal to user_drills table...")

# Example 3: Quick Fixes
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", 
     description="Fix RESTART button", 
     prompt="Read PLANNER_MASTER_CONTRACT.md and make RESTART button clear Practice Timeline...")

# REMEMBER: Each sub-agent MUST read this PLANNER_MASTER_CONTRACT.md first!
```

### **Sub-Agent Success Metrics:**
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive analysis of assigned components
- ‚úÖ Specific enhancement implementation for assigned feature
- ‚úÖ User approval for changes before implementation
- ‚úÖ Zero feature removal (only enhancement)
- ‚úÖ Connection to `powlax_drills` database table

**Each general-purpose sub-agent must focus on their specific task and get user approval before making changes.**

## üß™ **TESTING REQUIREMENTS**
**!IMPORTANT - ALL CHANGES MUST BE TESTED with PLAYWRIGHT**
- Test Save/Load persistence thoroughly
- Test custom drill/strategy creation and database saving
- Test custom drill/strategy editing functionality
- Test favorites persistence and routing
- Test RESTART button clears timeline
- Test mobile responsiveness (375px+)
- Verify all database connections work
- Verify proper error handling and user feedback

## üîí **SIMPLE COMPLETION PROTOCOL**

### **üö® GENERAL SUB-AGENTS: FOCUSED COMPLETION**
Each general-purpose sub-agent completes their specific task and reports back. No complex orchestration needed.

### **Checkout Process Requirements:**
```markdown
## üìã CONTRACT COMPLETION CHECKLIST

### **Implementation Status**
- [ ] All negotiated features implemented
- [ ] All sub-agent tasks completed and tested
- [ ] Playwright tests passing for all changes
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified
- [ ] Database connections working
- [ ] Error handling implemented

### **User Approval Required**
- [ ] User has tested the implementation
- [ ] User approves all changes made
- [ ] User confirms contract requirements met
- [ ] User grants permission to exit

### **Final Actions**
- [ ] Update component documentation
- [ ] Log all changes made
- [ ] Provide deployment instructions
- [ ] Archive completed contract
```

### **Exit Protocol:**
1. **Present Completion Summary** - Show all work completed
2. **Request User Testing** - Ask user to verify implementation
3. **Discuss Any Issues** - Address user concerns or modifications
4. **Get Explicit Approval** - "Do you approve contract completion and grant permission to exit?"
5. **Only Exit After "YES"** - Must receive explicit user approval

### **General Sub-Agent Task Management:**
```markdown
## ü§ñ GENERAL SUB-AGENT TASK MANAGEMENT

### **Focused Task Deployment:**
- Deploy one general-purpose sub-agent per specific task
- Each agent works on one component/feature independently
- Clear task boundaries prevent conflicts and confusion
- Simple sequential completion, no coordination needed

### **Sub-Agent Testing Requirements:**
- Each agent tests their own changes with Playwright
- Mobile responsiveness tests required (375px+)
- Database integration tests for data connections
- Component functionality tests before completion

### **Simple Reporting:**
- Each sub-agent reports completion independently
- User reviews each task completion before next agent
- No complex coordination or validation between agents
- Direct user feedback and approval for each task
```
