## ✅ **QUESTION 1: HOW TO GET STARTED WORKING IN THE NEW BRANCH**

**Answer:** Follow this exact sequence:

```bash
# 1. Create legacy branch (preserve current work)
git checkout -b legacy-bmad-a4cc
git add .
git commit -m "LEGACY: Complete BMad + A4CC agent system"
git push -u origin legacy-bmad-a4cc

# 2. Create new sub agent branch  
git checkout main
git checkout -b powlax-sub-agent-system
cp -r react-restart/* .
rm -rf react-restart
git add .
git commit -m "POWLAX SUB AGENT SYSTEM: Complete fresh start implementation"
git push -u origin powlax-sub-agent-system

# 3. Install POWLAX sub agents
cp -r claude-agents/* ~/.claude/agents/

# 4. Setup environment
npm install && npm run dev

# 5. Activate Master Controller in Claude Code
```

## ✅ **QUESTION 3: FEATURE BRANCH STRATEGY RECOMMENDATION**

**Answer: HYBRID APPROACH (RECOMMENDED)**

### **Main Structure:**
```
powlax-sub-agent-system/                    # Primary development branch
├── feature-mobile-optimization/            # Parallel feature development
├── feature-new-practice-planner/           # Isolated testing capability  
├── feature-age-band-interfaces/            # Risk-free integration
└── feature-coaching-workflow-enhancement/  # Sub agent specialization
```

### **Why Hybrid vs Single Branch:**

**✅ Hybrid Benefits:**
- **Parallel Development:** Multiple features simultaneously
- **Isolated Testing:** Each feature tested independently
- **Risk Management:** Feature failures don't affect others
- **Sub Agent Specialization:** Different agents on different features
- **Clean Integration:** Systematic merging back to main development

**❌ Single Branch Problems:**
- Development conflicts when multiple features touch same files
- Complex rollback if one feature fails
- Testing complexity with mixed feature changes
- Sub agent coordination conflicts

**Recommendation:** Use feature branches for each major feature, merge back to `powlax-sub-agent-system` systematically.

## ✅ **QUESTION 4: SYSTEMATIC PLAN WITH ALL AGENTS**

**Complete Sub Agent Coordination Plan Created:**

### **Phase 1: Infrastructure (Week 1)**
```
Master Controller: System architecture documentation, quality gate integration
powlax-backend-architect: Database optimization, API performance
powlax-frontend-developer: Component audit, mobile responsiveness
powlax-ux-researcher: User journey analysis, age band assessment

```

### **Phase 2: Feature Development (Week 2-8)**
```
Feature Branch Development:
├── Mobile Optimization (powlax-frontend-developer + powlax-ux-researcher)
├── Practice Planner (powlax-frontend-developer + powlax-backend-architect)
├── Age Band Interfaces (powlax-ux-researcher + powlax-frontend-developer)
└── Coaching Workflow (All agents coordinated by Master Controller)
```

### **Phase 3: Integration (Week 9-10)**
```
Master Controller Orchestrates:
├── Sequential feature merges
├── Comprehensive integration testing
