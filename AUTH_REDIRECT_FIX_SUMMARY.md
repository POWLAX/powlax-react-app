# Authentication Redirect Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Role Mapping in localStorage
**Problem**: When reading from localStorage, the auth context wasn't applying role mapping, so "admin" wasn't being converted to "administrator".

**Fix**: Added role mapping when reading localStorage users in `checkAuth()`:
```typescript
const mappedRoles = mapRoles(user.roles || ['player'])
const mappedRole = user.role === 'director' ? 'club_director' : 
                  user.role === 'admin' ? 'administrator' : 
                  user.role || 'player'
```

### 2. Debug Logging Added
Added console logging to track auth flow:
- `[Auth]` logs in checkAuth to see when localStorage is checked
- `[useRequireAuth]` logs to see redirect decisions

### 3. Debug Page Created
Created `/debug-auth` page to diagnose auth issues:
- Shows current auth state from both hooks
- Shows localStorage contents
- Provides buttons to set/clear auth
- Tests navigation to different pages

## How to Test

1. **Navigate to Debug Page**: http://localhost:3000/debug-auth
   - This page won't redirect you
   - Shows current auth status
   - Click "Set Direct Login (Admin)" to set admin auth

2. **After Setting Auth**:
   - You should see user loaded in all sections
   - Try navigating to different pages using the test buttons
   - Check browser console for `[Auth]` and `[useRequireAuth]` logs

3. **If Still Getting Redirected**:
   - Check console logs to see what's happening
   - The logs will show:
     - Whether localStorage has a user
     - Whether auth context sees the user
     - Why redirect is happening

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Still redirecting after direct login
**Possible Causes**:
1. Auth context not initialized when page loads
2. Race condition between mounting and auth check
3. Server components using Supabase Auth directly (not our custom auth)

**Solution**: 
- Use the debug page to verify auth is working
- Check console logs for timing issues
- For server components like `/skills-academy`, may need to convert to client components

### Issue: Admin pages not accessible
**Check**:
- User roles include "administrator" (not just "admin")
- Role mapping is working (check debug page)
- Navigation shows admin section

## Files Modified
1. `src/contexts/SupabaseAuthContext.tsx` - Fixed role mapping for localStorage, added debug logging
2. `src/app/(authenticated)/debug-auth/page.tsx` - Created debug page
3. Navigation already updated with admin links

## Next Steps if Issues Persist

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for `[Auth]` and `[useRequireAuth]` messages
2. **Use Debug Page**: Verify auth state is correct
3. **Server Components**: May need to convert server components to client components if they're not respecting localStorage auth

The authentication should now properly:
- Map roles from database format to expected format
- Persist across page navigation
- Show admin navigation when appropriate
- Not redirect when user is authenticated
