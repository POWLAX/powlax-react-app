# Authentication Race Condition Fix

## Problem Identified
A critical race condition was causing authenticated users to be redirected to login when navigating to certain pages.

### The Race Condition Sequence:
1. User navigates to a page (e.g., `/teams/1/practice-plans`)
2. Auth context starts with `loading: true`, `user: null`
3. Component mounts, but `checkAuth()` returns `false` if not yet mounted
4. `loading` gets set to `false` prematurely
5. **CRITICAL MOMENT**: `loading: false` and `user: null` (but localStorage hasn't been checked yet!)
6. `useRequireAuth()` sees this state and redirects to login
7. Meanwhile, localStorage check would have found the user

### Why Some Pages Worked:
- `/skills-academy` - Server Component, doesn't use client-side auth checking
- `/dashboard` - Sometimes worked if localStorage loaded fast enough

### Why Some Pages Failed:
- `/skills-academy/workouts` - Client Component with auth check
- `/teams/1/practice-plans` - Client Component with auth check
- These pages hit the race condition before localStorage was checked

## The Fix

### 1. Fixed Auth Context Initialization
**Before:** `checkAuth()` was called immediately, setting `loading: false` even before checking localStorage

**After:** Only set `loading: false` after actually checking localStorage when component is mounted

### 2. Added Initial Check Buffer
**Before:** `useRequireAuth()` would redirect immediately if no user found

**After:** Added 100ms initial check period to allow localStorage to be read before deciding to redirect

## Code Changes

### SupabaseAuthContext.tsx - Initialization Fix
```typescript
// Initial auth check - only set loading to false after actual check
if (mounted) {
  checkAuth().then((hasUser) => {
    console.log('[Auth] Initial check complete, has user:', hasUser)
    setLoading(false)
  })
}
```

### SupabaseAuthContext.tsx - useRequireAuth Fix
```typescript
const [initialCheck, setInitialCheck] = useState(true)

// Give auth context time to initialize
useEffect(() => {
  if (initialCheck) {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setInitialCheck(false)
    }, 100) // Small delay to allow localStorage check
    return () => clearTimeout(timer)
  }
}, [initialCheck])

// Don't redirect during initial check or while loading
if (initialCheck || loading) {
  return
}
```

## Result
✅ Auth context now properly checks localStorage before deciding user is absent
✅ No premature redirects during page navigation
✅ Consistent authentication state across all pages

## Testing
1. Use direct login at `/direct-login`
2. Navigate to any page - should work without redirects
3. Check browser console for `[Auth]` logs to see the proper sequence
