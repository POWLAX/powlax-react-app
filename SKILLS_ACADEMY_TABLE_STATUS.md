# Skills Academy Database Table Status

## ‚úÖ VERIFIED TABLE STRUCTURE

**Correct Tables (as confirmed by user):**
- `skills_academy_series` (41 records) - Series definitions and organization
- `skills_academy_workouts` (118 records) - Individual workout definitions 
- `skills_academy_drills` (167 records) - Complete drill library
- `skills_academy_workout_drills` (0 records) - **EMPTY** Junction table

## ‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUE: Missing Workout-Drill Connections

**Problem:** The junction table `skills_academy_workout_drills` is completely empty (0 records).

**Impact:**
- Workout modals show "0 drills" instead of actual drill names
- "Start Workout" button leads to "Workout Not Found" page
- No connection between 118 workouts and 167 available drills
- Workouts have `drill_count` values (e.g., 5, 10, 15) but no actual drill associations

## üîç TABLE DETAILS

### skills_academy_series (41 records)
```
Columns: id, series_name, series_slug, series_type, series_code, description, 
skill_focus, position_focus, difficulty_level, color_scheme, display_order, 
is_featured, is_active, is_premium, created_at, updated_at
```

### skills_academy_workouts (118 records)  
```
Columns: id, series_id, workout_name, workout_size, drill_count, description,
estimated_duration_minutes, original_json_id, original_json_name, is_active,
created_at, updated_at
```

### skills_academy_drills (167 records)
```
Columns: id, original_id, title, vimeo_id, drill_category, equipment_needed,
age_progressions, space_needed, complexity, sets_and_reps, duration_minutes,
point_values, tags, created_at, updated_at
```

### skills_academy_workout_drills (0 records) - **EMPTY**
```
Expected schema: workout_id, drill_id, sequence_order, etc.
Status: No records exist - this is why workouts have no drills
```

## üîß SOLUTIONS NEEDED

**Option 1: Populate Junction Table**
- Add records to `skills_academy_workout_drills` linking workouts to appropriate drills
- Based on workout type, difficulty, series, etc.

**Option 2: Helper Function**  
- Create programmatic connection between workouts and drills
- Use drill categories, tags, or workout metadata to auto-associate

**Option 3: Direct Connection**
- Modify queries to connect workouts directly to drills without junction table
- Use drill categories that match workout characteristics

## üìã CURRENT WORKAROUND

**Temporary Fix Applied:**
- Updated `WorkoutSizeSelector.tsx` to show mock drill names when real connections are empty
- Displays realistic drill progressions based on workout size (mini/more/complete)
- Prevents "0 drills" display in modal previews

**Code Location:**
- `/src/components/skills-academy/WorkoutSizeSelector.tsx` - Modal drill display
- `/src/hooks/useSkillsAcademyWorkouts.ts` - Data fetching with junction table queries
- `/src/app/(authenticated)/skills-academy/workout/[id]/page.tsx` - Workout runner page

## üéØ NEXT STEPS

1. **Populate Junction Table** - Add workout-drill relationships to `skills_academy_workout_drills`
2. **Test Connections** - Verify drill data flows from workouts through junction table
3. **Update Video Integration** - Connect drill `vimeo_id` fields to video player
4. **Remove Mock Data** - Replace temporary drill names with real database connections
