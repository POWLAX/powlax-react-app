# Workout Page Runtime Error Fix

## Problem
The workout page was throwing a runtime error:
```
ReferenceError: Cannot access 'workout' before initialization
```

This was happening at line 131 in `/skills-academy/workout/[id]/page.tsx`

## Root Cause
The component was trying to use a variable called `workout` in several useEffect hooks, but this variable wasn't defined until later in the component (line 208). The actual workout data was coming from `session?.workout` returned by the `useWorkoutSession` hook.

## The Fix
Changed all early references from `workout` to `session?.workout`:

### Before:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (workout) { // ❌ workout not defined yet
    // ...
  }
}, [workout])
```

### After:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (session?.workout) { // ✅ Correct reference
    // ...
  }
}, [session?.workout])
```

## Files Modified
- `/src/app/(authenticated)/skills-academy/workout/[id]/page.tsx`

## Changes Made:
1. Line 122: Changed `if (workout)` to `if (session?.workout)`
2. Line 123: Changed `getWallBallVideoId(workout)` to `getWallBallVideoId(session.workout)`
3. Line 131: Changed dependency from `[workout]` to `[session?.workout]`
4. Line 135: Changed `if (workout?.series_id)` to `if (session?.workout?.series_id)`
5. Line 139: Changed `workout.series_id` to `session.workout.series_id`
6. Line 145: Changed dependency from `[workout?.series_id]` to `[session?.workout?.series_id]`
7. Lines 160, 189, 196: Fixed progress saving references

## Result
✅ Page now loads without runtime errors
✅ Workout data properly accessed from session
✅ All useEffect hooks have correct dependencies

## Testing
The workout page at `/skills-academy/workout/138` now loads successfully with a 200 status code.
